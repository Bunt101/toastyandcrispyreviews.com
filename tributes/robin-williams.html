        <p>On July 21, 1951, one of America's funniest men was born. He was known as one of the most creative, funniest, sharpest, generous, energetic, adaptive, and overall just a great guy. This man could turn any frown upside down with his quick comedic slapsick humor, or without him even doing anything you can still look at him and smile. That's how much of an impact he's left on us.</p>
        <p>10 years ago today, America lost one of the funniest men of all time. That man was named Robin McLaurin Williams. But often went by Robin Williams. He was known for his rapid-fire wit and the ability to seamlessly blend humor with deep emotion. Williams rose to fame with the TV show Mork & Mindy and became a beloved film star with roles in Good Morning, Vietnam, Dead Poets Society, and Mrs. Doubtfire. Other than movies and TV shows, Williams was great at impressions, he does a great <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/tributes/marlon-brando.html" target="_self">Marlon Brando</a>, Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, and many others.</p>
        <p>In 1973, Williams had attended Juilliard School in New York City, there he met the man who would become <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/superman-1978.html" target="_self">Superman</a>, Christopher Reeve. They became close friends during their time there, studying under the renowned acting teacher John Houseman. Williams and Reeve maintained a deep friendship throughout their lives, supporting each other through personal and professional challenges. Their bond was particularly notable for how they remained close even as their careers took them in different directions, with Williams often visiting Reeve after his paralyzing accident in 1995.</p>
        <p>After Christopher Reeve passed away in 2004, Williams was devastated. Reeve's death was a profound loss for Williams, who often referred to Reeve as a source of strength and inspiration. The grief from losing his close friend added to the emotional challenges Williams faced during this period, including his battles with depression, addiction, and his own health issues. The combination of these factors further complicated Williams' mental and emotional well-being in the years leading up to his own passing.</p>
        <p>Despite his public success, Williams struggled with depression and addiction throughout his life, despite his outwardly joyful and energetic persona. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he struggled with cocaine and alcohol abuse, eventually quitting after the death of his friend John Belushi. Though he remained sober for years, Williams relapsed into alcoholism in the early 2000s, seeking treatment in 2006. He also faced deep depression, exacerbated by his later diagnosis with Lewy body dementia, a neurodegenerative disease that significantly impacted his mental health. These struggles ultimately contributed to his tragic death in 2014, bringing attention to the complexities of mental health and addiction.</p>
        <p>It's sad to think about all things Williams had went through, but I don't think he wanted to remembered for his struggles, but instead for all the laughs he brought to people. Forever, Robin Williams will remain as one of the funniest men of all time and among one of the greatest comedians of all time. He was taken from us too early and I wish he were still around. He, George Carlin, Don Rickles, and Richard Pryor are my top four favorite comedians of all time and America hasn't been the same without them.</p>
