        <p>Maggie Smith was born on December 28, 1934, in Ilford, Essex. As a young girl, she became interested in theater. At the age of 17, under the auspices of the Oxford University Dramatic Society, Smith began her career at the Oxford Playhouse, performing in Shakespearean and other plays. Later, she transitioned into film and became a prominent film actress.</p>
        <p>Throughout her career, she starred in films such as "The V.I.P.s" (1963), "Othello" (1965), "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie" (1969), "Travels with My Aunt" (1972), "California Suite" (1978), "A Room with a View" (1985), "The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne" (1987), and many more.</p>
        <p>From 2001 to 2011, Maggie Smith portrayed Professor Minerva McGonagall in the <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/HP1-2001.html" target="_self">Harry Potter</a> film series,  based on the books by J.K. Rowling. She had previously acted alongside Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) in "David Copperfield" (1999). Her role as Professor McGonagall made her an icon and introduced her to a new generation of fans. It remains one of her most iconic roles.</p>
        <p>After "Harry Potter," she starred in the drama series "Downton Abbey," which ran from 2010 to 2015 and also spawned spinoffs. This became her second most significant role to her modern fans. Her portrayal of the quick-witted matriarch won her three Primetime Emmy Awards, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, and four Screen Actors Guild Awards. She reprised her role as Violet Crawley in the "Downton Abbey" films in 2019 and 2022.</p>
        <p>Over her career, Maggie Smith earned 58 awards and received 157 nominations, making her one of the most highly decorated actresses. However, these awards were merely a testament to her extraordinary talent on screen. She was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 1999, alongside other esteemed British actresses.</p>
        <p>Outside of her acting career, Maggie faced health issues, including being diagnosed with Graves' disease in 1988, breast cancer in 2007, and glaucoma. Despite these challenges, she continued to persevere. Many of her co-stars shared how kind and sweet she was as a person. Maggie passed away peacefully on September 27, 2024, at the age of 89. She will be deeply missed by not only Harry Potter fans but by fans of her entire body of work.</p>
