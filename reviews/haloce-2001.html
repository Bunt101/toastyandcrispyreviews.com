        <p>First-person shooters have come a long way since the mid-90s, with games like DOOM, Star Wars: Dark Forces, Quake, and Half-Life. Among the popular ones is Halo. Originally developed by Bungie and later managed by 343 Industries, Halo became a household name within the gaming franchise, published by Microsoft. Even if you haven't played it, the name "Halo" is iconic. It all started in 2001 when Microsoft released their first console, the Xbox. Similar to how Nintendo releases a new Mario game with each new console, Microsoft does the same with Halo and Xbox. The first Halo game, simply titled "Halo: Combat Evolved," was released in 2001 for both Xbox and Microsoft Windows.</p>
        <p>The game features a campaign, and an online multiplayer mode. The campaign features the following story with the human ship Pillar of Autumn escaping a Covenant attack and discovering Halo. Master Chief (Steve Downes) and Cortana (Jen Taylor) crash-land on the ringworld and lead the fight against Covenant forces. As they explore, they learn that Halo is not just a ringworld but a massive superweapon designed to contain and, if necessary, destroy the Flood, a parasitic alien species. The situation escalates when the Flood is accidentally released, turning the conflict into a three-way battle. Master Chief and Cortana ally with the AI 343 Guilty Spark (Tim Dadabo) to activate Halo's defenses, only to discover that doing so will wipe out all sentient life in the galaxy. Realizing the danger, they decide to destroy Halo instead. In the climax, Master Chief and Cortana overload the Pillar of Autumn's engines, causing a massive explosion that destroys Halo. They escape just in time, floating in space and vowing to continue the fight against the Covenant. The game ends with a sense of both victory and foreboding as the broader conflict remains unresolved.</p>
        <p>The plot feels inspired by "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)," which contributes to its compelling nature. It's a simple story, but simplicity isn't necessarily a bad thing—it has to work and fit in with everything else. I was invested in the story, the characters, the world-building, the scenery, the action, the weapons, and the technology. Let's not forget that iconic theme—easily one of the best themes not only in video games but in any franchise. I remember back in my freshman year of high school, all the guys gathered in the bathroom to sing the Halo theme. It was awesome. The game features four levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Heroic, and the infamous Legendary difficulty. Heroic may be the "canon" way of playing Halo, but Legendary is where it all comes down to. It's ride or die.</p>
        <p>The multiplayer mode adds to the experience. It features both local and online multiplayer. I can't tell you how many times people have shared their fond memories of playing Halo online with friends both locally and online. Additionally, you and a friend can play the campaign together. Just try not to get yourself killed, or you'll end up getting into a screaming match for the rest of the night.</p>
        <p>This game not only has become a cult classic, but it also sparked one of the best video game franchises out there. Great work from Bungie and Microsoft. The Master Chief's final line, "No, I think we're just getting started," perfectly sets up what is to come.</p>
