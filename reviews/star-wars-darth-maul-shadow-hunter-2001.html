        <p><a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-i.html" target="_self">The Phantom Menace</a> has always had a special place in my heart. I've been a fan of it since I was a kid, and love it more than I did as a kid. One of the things that drew me into the film was Darth Maul. He was a character so creepy and cool looking, even though he hardly spoke in the film. He always was mysterious to me, and I wanted to learn more about him. Like James Luceno's "Cloak of Deception" and "Darth Plagueis," Michael Reaves' "Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter" set up a lot of things in "The Phantom Menace." <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/star-wars-cloak-of-deception-2001.html" target="_self">Cloak of Deception</a> explains the political subplot of the film, <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/star-wars-darth-plagueis-2012.html" target="_self">Darth Plagueis</a> sets up that film and all of the prequels, and "Shadow Hunter" tells a story about Darth Maul and sets up his character, as well as building up that part of "The Phantom Menace."</p>
        <p>The story begins with Darth Sidious discovering that the 4th Trade Federation member and the second-in-command to Nute Gunray, Hath Monchar, has gone missing. Fearing that the plan to have a blockade over the planet Naboo will be leaked to the public and the Jedi, Darth Sidious sends his apprentice, Darth Maul, to hunt him down. Meanwhile, two partners, Lorn Pavan and his droid, I-Five, are contacted by Hath Monchar who offers the two information regarding the blockade over Naboo. Intrigued, the two accept the offer but are soon on the run from the law and Darth Maul. While that's happening, Jedi Padawan, Darsha Assant, is sent on a mission, serving as a test for Knighthood. She crosses paths with Lorn after failing her mission, but believes, as well as her master, would be made up if she brings Lorn before the Temple to provide them with the information given to him by the traitorous Neimoidian.</p>
        <p>This book is very enjoyable and has great pacing, so you can likely finish it in a day or two. The story feels like a cat-and-mouse chase as well as feeling like an action/thriller novel. Even if you already know what happens in the Prequels, you'll still feel excited, and that's the genius behind this novel. Reaves, may he rest in peace, had a remarkable ability to play with the reader's emotions. He also wasn't afraid to use a diverse vocabulary. In almost every chapter, he includes a high-level vocabulary word that is impressive but used in a way that makes it easy to understand, even if you don't already know the word; the context helps clarify its meaning. This would be a good novel for children who are trying to learn and expand their vocabulary, and of course, if they love Star Wars. Who cares if this isn't canon anymore? I don't. I still consider it canon.</p>
        <p>The characters introduced in this novel, apart from those we already know from the films, are all well-written and engaging. As the story unfolds, you gradually learn more about them—such as their pasts, actions, emotions, and feelings. You can genuinely feel their development throughout the narrative. Lorn Pavan and Dasha Assant, in particular, are exquisitely crafted characters that readers can relate to and root for. It's rare to find characters in novels that are this well-developed. (No, Tolkien doesn't count, as he often spends an entire section of a chapter explaining a minor side character, only for them to never appear again.)</p>
        <p>If you are familiar with "The Phantom Menace," you likely know that Darth Maul is portrayed as a physical presence, almost like a brute. Though he speaks very little, his actions speak volumes. His introductory scene demonstrates the kind of Sith he is, beginning with a training exercise that sets the tone for his character in the novel. He is a powerful being and someone who is filled with hate and rage, as that's how Sidious raised him. To me, that's a great way of introducing a character like that.</p>
        <p>Overall, the book is a lot of fun and can be enjoyed by fans of the prequels, Darth Maul, and action/thriller novels. The movie tie-ins are well done, making it an excellent prequel to "The Phantom Menace." If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend giving it a try—you won't be disappointed!</p>
