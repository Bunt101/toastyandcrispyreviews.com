        <p>He is a handsome, young urban professional named Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), who leads a second life as a gruesome serial killer by night in New York City in 1987. "American Psycho," a film released in 2000, is based on the novel of the same name. While the book and even the film are considered controversial, the movie itself is a decent adaptation. At least, I found it good.</p>
        <p>The film follows Patrick Bateman, a wealthy New York City investment banker in 1987, who leads a double life as a serial killer. Bateman's meticulously maintained facade of success and charm hides his dark impulses, as he brutally murders colleagues, homeless people, and even his lovers. The film delves into his increasingly unhinged mental state, highlighted by his obsessive routines and moments of introspection. As Bateman's violent tendencies spiral out of control, he confesses his crimes to his lawyer, only to be dismissed as a joke, leaving viewers questioning the reality of his confessions and the nature of his madness.</p>
        <p>Bale is joined by Willem Dafoe, who plays Detective Donald Kimball, investigating the disappearance of Bateman's colleague Paul Allen, portrayed by Jared Leto. Allen's murder is a pivotal plot point. Reese Witherspoon plays Evelyn Williams, Bateman's oblivious fiancée, while Chloë Sevigny portrays Jean, his vulnerable secretary who narrowly escapes his violence. Samantha Mathis appears as Courtney Rawlinson, Bateman's mistress, adding to the film's exploration of moral decay. The supporting cast, including Justin Theroux, Josh Lucas, and Bill Sage, enhances the dark satire of 1980s yuppie culture.</p>
        <p>Bret Easton Ellis's 1991 best-selling novel was passed around publishers like a hot potato. It spent years going through various writers, directors, and stars as a cinematic project. Oliver Stone initially planned to direct it with Leonardo DiCaprio starring, but it ultimately ended up back in Harron's hands with Christian Bale in the lead role. Casting Leonardo DiCaprio wouldn’t have felt right and wouldn’t have been as successful. Casting Christian Bale was the right choice because his captivating performance in "American Psycho" keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. With a nuanced portrayal, he navigates the fine line between comedy and terror, leaving viewers to perceive the film's unsettling world through both darkly humorous and deeply chilling lenses.</p>
