        <p>This novel has a very nice tragic story. I applaud Sean Stewart for writing this.</p>
        <p>Aside from the story, I really love the scenes with Yoda and Dooku together. Especially the end. It's very dark, horrifying, and tragic all at the same time. It's my favorite part of the novel. One of the things I appreciated from this novel was Yoda's sense of humor. Yoda was a very serious character in the prequels, but when he first introduced in the Original Trilogy, he had a great sense of humor, which I appreciate Sean Stewart bringing back.</p>
        <p>The reason why I picked up this novel was not only cause I'm a collector, but I really like the Clone Wars era, and the characters in the Star Wars universe. Yoda has always been a fascinating character to me, and even Dooku. I was engaged with the "A plot" because I wanted to know how the meeting would go. However, as much I loved the Yoda and Dooku scenes, aka the "A plot." I did feel like this novel's "B plot" was a bit slow. Don't get me wrong, I did find it kind of interesting, but it was very slow. Furthermore, I did find this book's writing and pacing to be slow at most times. I wasn't a fan of the long chapters, as it had too many plot points with terrible pacing. Other Star Wars novels had better pacing chapters, but this one doesn't. But, maybe that's just me.</p>
        <p>Overall, this novel was a good and entertaining read. Certainly one of the better Clone Wars novels. I'd recommend it if you're a fan of Yoda and the Clone Wars.</p>
