        <p>After watching the first ten minutes, I realized how much I don't care for tornadoes.</p>
        <p>"Twisters (2024)" is supposedly, a thrilling sequel to the iconic 1996 film "Twister." The story follows a group of storm chasers, led by meteorologist Jo Thornton, as they encounter an unprecedented series of superstorms wreaking havoc across the Midwest. As they race against time to deploy new, advanced tornado-tracking technology, Jo's daughter, Amy, discovers a shocking family secret that ties their past to the present storm crisis. Amid the chaos, the team faces life-threatening challenges, including a colossal F5 tornado that puts their skills and resilience to the ultimate test. Alongside breathtaking action sequences, the film explores themes of legacy, redemption, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.</p>
        <p>The problem with movies like this is that, in order to gain the permission of production corporations, the writers either compose a tale utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT or replicate the original. With this movie, the original is imitated and made even worse than it was. I was barely interested in anything that happened because the plot, the characters, and the action were so dull. The budget probably went to the special effects.</p>
        <p>If the film had a plot that was enjoyable, entertaining, and impactful, then I probably would've enjoyed this a lot more, but people and production companies seem to be more interested in films with mindless special effects. Instead, we're left with a film that consists of too many characters, a forgettable plot, mindless special effects, a story that was aiming to be a love story, and a big gust of wind.</p>
