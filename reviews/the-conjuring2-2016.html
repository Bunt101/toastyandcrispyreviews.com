        <p>While discussing horror films with a friend of mine, he recommended "The Conjuring," so I gave that one a watch, and loved it. My review can be found for that. When the movie ended, HBO Max recommended me the second one, so I gave it a watch and was again taken by surprise. I loved it, just as I did the first one. Those two are the type of modern horror films that I've been looking for.</p>
        <p>In 1977, seven years after the events of the first film, paranormal investigators Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) come out of a self-imposed sabbatical to travel to Enfield, a borough in north London. There, they meet Peggy Hodgson (Frances O'Connor), an overwhelmed single mother of four who confides in the couple about an evil presence in her home. Ed and Lorraine believe her story when her youngest daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), begins to show signs of demonic possession. As the Warrens work to help the besieged girl, they soon become the next targets of the malicious spirit.</p>
        <p>Ed and Lorraine are both wonderful people. We need more people like them in this world. They're willing to help anyone out just to help make their lives easier. Both grew up in enviorments which people didn't believe them, but once the two finally met, the decide to dedicate their similarties and use that to help others who are suffering. When they're not doing work, they're hangout with the family they're helping which make them apart of the family. Janet and her siblings love their company and feel safe around them because Ed and Lorraine were able to connect to those kids. One of my favorite scenes is when Ed decides to buy the kids records of Elvis Presley's albums, because their father used to listen to Elvis with his kids, but when the record player didn't work, Ed decides to sing them a song and have them sing along with them. Similar to Maria Von Trapp in <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/sound-of-music-1965.html" target="_self">The Sound of Music</a>.</p>
        <p>James Wan has established himself as a master of the genre with "The Conjuring" and has shown himself to be a competent producer on films like "Saw" and "Insidious." It had the ideal fusion of horror clichés, expertly designed to feel as new and chilling as the first haunted house films of the 1980s. Another "based on true events" story. But a different one. There was more jumpscares, and there were different enemies, all though it was Valak, who was the real demon. All of them are scary, not only because of their looks but because of the terrible things they can do to you. Just like what happened to poor Regan in <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/the-exorcist-1973.html" target="_self">The Exorcist</a>.</p>
        <p>While "The Conjuring 2" follows a similar formula and structure to its predecessor, it attempts new elements by featuring a different location, unique characters, more jump scares, heightened emotion, and stronger moral themes. With these additions, the sequel stands as grand as the first film. It's definitely more scary than the first! If one were to ask me which one I prefer, that is something I cannot answer, because I don't know the answer. All I can say is that they're some of the best horror films of the 21st Century.</p>
        <p>Also, Anita Gregory, the worst character in this movie. Probably cause she was written this why. Bad, but in the good way. If she was telling me that Janet was faking, I would've either smacked her, or left her in the house by herself with Janet. That way she could stop being jealous, or just skeptic. At least she isn't as bad as Dolores Umbridge.</p>
