        <h1>Review: Star Wars: Cloak of Deception (2001)</h1>
        <h2>"Do you know why Valorum loves to attend the opera? Because it's the only place on Coruscant where an entire audience will applaud him." ―Orn Free Taa</h2>
        <h3>★★★½</h3>
        <img src="Cloak_of_Deception_Cover.webp" height="500"> 
        <p>This was my first James Luceno novel. And going in, I enjoyed his writing style and his story telling. I'm a fan of The Phantom Menace, being my 2nd favorite prequel film.</p>
        <p>This book serves as a precursor to <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-i.html" target="_blank">The Phantom Menace</a> and helps to contextualize its events, particularly its political subplot. Palpatine, Valorum, and Qui-Gon are three characters who appear frequently in this book and who, in my opinion, are its most vital figures.</p>
        <p>Cloak of Deception is told in four parts: Dorvalla, Coruscant, The Outlying Systems, and The Inner Circle. It explores the intricate political landscape of the Galactic Republic just before "The Phantom Menace." Chancellor Valorum is beleaguered by corruption and a growing confidence crisis. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, investigate terrorist attacks orchestrated by the Nebula Front, revealing collusion with the Trade Federation. Manipulated by Darth Sidious, these events culminate in an assassination attempt at a trade summit on Eriadu, further destabilizing the Republic. The novel sets the stage for the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo and the rise of Sidious’s influence, leading directly into the events of "The Phantom Menace."</p>
        <p>Luceno tells a great story and gives a lot of character development for Qui-Gon Jinn, Palpatine, Valorum, Cohl, Obi-Wan, and Rella. As well as providing us with exciting action, mystery, and all kinds of surprises.</p>
        <p>It's obviously not the best James Luceno Star Wars novel, but I find it to be one of the best, at least 2nd or 3rd best.</p>
        <p>I would've liked to have more character development for the side characters that play a role in this story, but I can forgive that cause basically everything else can cancel that out.</p>
        <p>James Luceno compared this to J.R.R Tolken's The Hobbit, and I agree with that! You can tell George Lucas had complete trust in James Luceno, even allowing him to see a compeleted script of Attack of the Clones.</p>
        <p>Having re-read this and re-watching Phantom Menace, poor Valorum. He didn't deserve any of this. He was a good man but beleaguered.</p>
        <p>Overall, a remarkable underrated book that deserves more attention and that I enjoyed reading. I re-read this just before I went into the cinema to watch The Phantom Menace for its 25th Anniversary. I had a good time coming back to this novel.</p>
    <div class="rating">Rating: 3.5/4 stars.</div>
