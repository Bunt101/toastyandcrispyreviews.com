        <p>The war has indeed begun.</p>
        <p>"X-Men 2 (2003)" or "X2" is a fantastic ride; it's basically "X-Men (2000)," but done a lot better! It takes more risks with its story, character development, tension-building, and action. This is exactly what the first film set up. I appreciate Bryan Singer's storytelling here.</p>
        <p>The film starts out in the White House with a shapeshifting mutant named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), who breaks in and attacks the White House, only to find out that a man named William Stryker (Brian Cox) used a serum to control mutants' minds. He's also been using it on Magneto (Ian McKellen) to learn more about Cerebro, which he and Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) built to track other mutants. Meanwhile, Logan goes to the place Charles sent him, only to find nothing there. He later returns to the mansion to be a "babysitter" to the kids while Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) track down Nightcrawler and recruit him, and Scott (James Marsden) and Charles visit Magneto. However, while they're away, William Stryker attacks the mansion. Colossus helps take the kids out, while Wolverine, Rogue, Bobby (Iceman), and Pyro escape to Boston.</p>
        <p>What this film does is not make Magneto the main enemy, as in the previous film. William Stryker is the main enemy. Instead, Magneto and Mystique help the X-Men rescue Charles and stop William Stryker. At the same time, Wolverine learns a little more about his past, although it isn't complete. But it is enough to give us a glimpse of what actually happened. David Hayter's screenplay shines once again in this film. There are a lot of great lines here. I also really love the casting of Nightcrawler and William Stryker. Both bring excitement, charm, and essence to their characters.</p>
        <p>These kinds of films can be enjoyed in many ways, whether it's the memorable moments, the story, the characters, the action, the comedy, or the tension. This is no doubt the best of the trilogy, and no doubt my favorite in the series. They aren't perfect, but that's okay. I still really enjoy them nevertheless.</p>
        <p>Can this be considered a good sequel? Yes, for sure! But it's definitely not on the list of the greatest sequels ever made. It makes for a better superhero film, though. Most of the X-Men films are, as a matter of fact. In my opinion, they're better than most MCU films. I'd rather have my superhero film be mature like this with some humor instead of a film that's mostly CGI with bad dialogue, as most MCU films are.</p>
        <p>If you enjoyed the first X-Men film, then you'll most certainly enjoy this one.</p>
