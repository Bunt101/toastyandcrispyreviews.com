        <p>There's no debate when it comes to the best Christmas movie, for me at least. It's Home Alone 1 & 2, and "Die Hard" 1 & 2. Home Alone has always been a movie I watch every Christmas, mainly cause it would always be on TV, it has since grown on me, which I why I consider it one of my favorite Christmas movies. There's always something special seeing Kevin being a badass, defending his house from two idiot robbers.</p>
        <p>The film starts with the McCallister family, preparing for a trip to Paris. Kevin (Macaulay Culkin), the youngest, of his family, not his uncle's, feels left out, as he always gets in trouble. Before going to bed, he wished for his family to disapear. A power outage causes the family to rush to the airport the very next morning, leaving Kevin behind. Kevin, using his 8-year-old imagination, believed he made his family disapear. Now, he has the entire house to himself, but it doesn't take too long for his family to realize what they've done. Throughout the whole trip, Peter (John Heard) and Kate McCallister (Catherine O'Hara) try everything to make sure he's okay, and get a flight back to Chicago as soon as possible. Meanwhile, these two robbers, called "The Wet Bandits," named Harry Lime (Joe Pesci) and Marv Murchins (Daniel Stern) take interest in the McCallister family, and its up to Kevin stop them.</p>
        <p>Macaulay Culkin's portrayal of Kevin is beloved for a reason. He's a kid, but a kid that people should take seriously. His portrayal sent a message to kids, telling them to never be afraid. He even gave Old Man Marley (Roberts Blossom) some good advice. There's just so many good themes in this movie, and I love the family aspect of it. Even though your family can be annoying, you still love them at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>Other than Culkin, Pesci and Stern are great. They're idiots, but not the kind where you cringe when watching. They're able to build off each other, with Harry being the only one with half a brain, and Marv, with a bit of brain. They're sort of like cartoon villains. Their banter with each other is the best. What's funny is that Joe Pesci was also filming "Goodfellas" at the same time. Talk about two great performances in one year.</p>
        <p>If you haven't seen this movie yet, what rock have you been living under? You should definitely check it out! It's a fun Christmas film that's perfect for the holiday season. It’s not violent; instead, it feels like a live-action cartoon filled with great morals and themes. The performances are entertaining, the music by John Williams is fantastic, and the pacing is just right, complemented by witty dialogue that adds to the charm.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the film captures the spirit of Christmas wonderfully, showcasing the importance of family, friendship, and the joy of giving. The vibrant visuals and creative storytelling make it enjoyable for viewers of all ages. Whether you’re watching it alone or with loved ones, it’s sure to bring a smile to your face and put you in the festive spirit. Don't miss out on this delightful holiday classic!</p>
