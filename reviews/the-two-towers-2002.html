        <p>After <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/fellowship-2001.html" target="_self">Fellowship of the Ring</a>, it was only natural to continue with the sequel. Out of all the films in trilogy, this one is my favorite, mainly due to Battle of Helm's Deep, but I'll get to that later. "The Two Towers" continues the adventure of the first film by introducing us to new characters and enemies. All of which are memorable than the actual movie. That doesn't make it a bad thing- well, actually it does because story is important.</p>
        <p>"The Two Towers" continues the journey of the fractured Fellowship. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) press on toward Mordor, guided—and endangered—by the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) pursue Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been captured by Saruman's orcs but manage to escape with the help of the enigmatic Treebeard, a walking tree-like creature. The film builds to the epic Battle of Helm's Deep, where men, elves, and dwarves unite to fend off Saruman's massive army, while Frodo begins to feel the Ring's corrupting influence more acutely.</p>
        <p>Just like the last film, this focuses less on the Hobbits, Frodo and Samwise, and focuses more on supporting characters. It's like Peter Jackson forgot who were the main characters and the supporting characters and has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. At least Samwise gets some character development, but Frodo is the least developed character in this movie. All he does is trusts Gollum and says "no" to Sam. Never understood why he trusts a mutated Hobbit rather than his gardener who saved his life countless times.</p>
        <p>The Battle of Helm's Deep is the highlight of this movie. It features one of the greatest action sequences ever filmed. The scene is brutal, intense, dark, and thrilling. Every actor has their moment to shine.  The atmosphere is charged with tension as the forces of good prepare to defend their stronghold against overwhelming odds. The cinematography captures the chaos of battle beautifully, immersing the audience in every clash and explosion. The score heightens the emotional stakes, making each moment feel even more urgent and desperate. Overall, this sequence not only showcases exceptional filmmaking but also deepens the characters' struggles, making it a truly unforgettable experience.</p>
        <p>At first, I rated them all 4 out of 4 stars, but as I write my reviews, their ratings have decreased from 4 to 3 due to my analysis of the films. I’ve taken a closer look at various elements like the plot development, character depth, and overall execution. While I initially enjoyed the films, deeper reflection has revealed some flaws that I hadn't noticed before. This process of reevaluation has helped me develop a more nuanced perspective on each film's strengths and weaknesses, leading to a more accurate assessment of their overall quality.</p>
