        <h1>Review: The Score (2001)</h1>
        <h2>The Score of Three Great Actors</h2>
        <h2>★★★½</h2>
        <img src="Brando&DeNiro.jpg" height="500">
        <p></p>
        <p>Nick Wells, played by Robert De Niro, is a jazz club owner in Montreal's old town who is not native to the city based on his French. In the title sequence, he is seen attempting to get into a safe in Boston as part of his second work as a break-in specialist. Never rob where you reside, according to his guidelines. However, he now receives an offer from his old pal Max (Marlon Brando), a Montreal mafia leader. He is aware of a priceless antique in the Customs House in Montreal, as well as a method for stealing it. A contact named Jack (Edward Norton), a building janitor, is the key to his scheme. By posing as "Brian," whose speech and movement appear to be impacted by some sort of brain disease, Jack has become a favored child there.</p>
        <p>This was a lot of fun. It's one of the best heist movies. Anything with Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando is always a joy to watch. Seeing two of the greatest actors of all time was like watching The Godfather talking to his younger self.</p>
        <p>The dynamic between De Niro and Brando is electrifying, and their performances elevate the entire film. It's fascinating to see how their characters interact, each bringing their unique style and depth to the roles. The tension and chemistry make every scene captivating as if they’re passing the torch while simultaneously reminding us of the legacy of classic cinema, even though De Niro has already made a name for himself at that point.</p>
        <p>Edward Norton is pretty great in this as well. He plays the young, but witty and smart assistant to Marlon Brando's character, Max. He does a good job convincing everyone that he is a mentally disabled person. He also has good chemistry with both De Niro and Brando. Norton has also mentioned how much he enjoyed working with both stars and if you look at his acting, you can tell he's enjoying himself.</p>
        <p>The plot twists and clever strategies make it not only thrilling but also intellectually engaging. Each heist sequence is meticulously crafted, keeping you on the edge of your seat. Plus, the cinematography and soundtrack complement the intensity of the story beautifully, immersing you further into the world of crime and betrayal.</p>
        <p>The director of this film is Frank Oz, known for playing/voicing Yoda in Star Wars, Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear in The Muppets, and Cookie Monster, Bert, and Grover on Sesame Street, and being close friends and partners with the late Jim Henson. Oz's directing style is unique. He has a good talent for it. Some shots are interesting and don't need dialogue to tell the audience what each actor feels.</p>
        <p>Overall, it’s a masterclass in filmmaking that celebrates both the craft and the art of acting, making it a must-watch for any film lover. This would be Marlon Brando's final film role and even though he didn't get along with Frank Oz and was very fat at this point in his life, he still gave a fun performance.</p>
        <p></p>
