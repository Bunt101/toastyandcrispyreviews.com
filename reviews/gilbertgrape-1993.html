        <p>In high school, I had this teacher who was very sweet and friendly, and cared about family. She wanted to show us a film relating to the subject, and she picked this movie. I believe she saw it in the cinema when it came out, but that's beyond the point. She showed us this film and I enjoyed it. It was a film that stuck with me for a while. After my old teacher showed us this film, I rewatched it two more times after that. After those two rewatches, I enjoyed it a lot more than the previous times. Something about this film has a certain rewatch value to it. Was it the story, characters, or morals? I would tell you, but I can't, because I can't quite put my finger on it.</p>
        <p>"What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)" centers on Gilbert (Johnny Depp), a young guy in a small village who must take care of his severely obese mother (Darlene Cates) and his mentally challenged brother Arnie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Gilbert feels constrained by his family's requirements and finds it difficult to strike a balance between his obligations and his personal ambitions. When a free-spirited woman named Becky (Juliette Lewis) moves to the area and gives him a peek of a different existence, things start to shift. The movie delves into issues of familial bonds, selflessness, and individual development as Gilbert must make tough decisions regarding his future.</p>
        <p>My favorite character is Gilbert. He was the second oldest and had a huge weight on his shoulders, meaning he was the responsible one to take care of the family. His older brother graduated and left. Their father had passed. The mother was thin until she became overweight, making it difficult to leave the house. Gilbert's sisters were old enough—at least the oldest one; the other was probably still a teen. However, Gilbert assumed the role of the "head of the house." Gilbert loves his family, but he's put under a lot of stress. Gilbert could've been something, like Telly (Marlon Brando) from <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/on-the-waterfront-1954.html" target="_self">On The Waterfront</a> could've been something, instead of a bum. He once reached a boiling point, leading to beating up his younger brother, Arnie, which he later regretted.</p>
        <p>Other than Gilbert, Arnie is another fan favorite. He was mentally disabled, but he was always so happy, full of life and energy, and genuinely cared about everyone. Leonardo DiCaprio did an excellent job portraying a mentally disabled kid. He avoided caricaturing or stereotyping Arnie's disability, instead bringing depth and nuance to the character. It's easy to play a character like that, but difficult not to make it offensive. He was about 17-18 years old when filming, and he was a natural. </p>
        <p>"What's Eating Gilbert Grape" demonstrates that despite all of their eccentricities and difficulties, family is everything. Gilbert's efforts for the Grape family show how deeply devoted he is to them, and it is evident how much the Grape family loves and supports one another. The film teaches us to value and cherish our own families in spite of their flaws. I believe that's why my old teacher decided to show us this movie, and honestly, I'm glad she did.</p>
        <p>Many people claimed that they didn't understand what "was eating Gilbert Grape." Well, I have a theory. Responsibility  and his family were "eating him." He could've been something, but instead, he had to stay behind and take care of the family. His sisters had to do the cooking and cleaning. His younger brother suffered from a mental disability, which prevented him from being responsible. Gilbert had to take care of him, making him "the man of the house." Regardless, this movie has some incredibly beautiful and inspiring morals. Leonardo DiCaprio and Johnny Depp make excellent brothers. It's one of the best films of 1993, and it's one of the best films of all time.</p>
