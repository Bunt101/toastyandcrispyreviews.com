        <p>Watching this made me realize that video game movies, or movies based on video games, rarely succeed, except for a few exceptions. "Free Guy" is easily one of the worst and cheesiest movies I've seen. In hindsight, the issues in the game could have been resolved by erasing the entire source code and starting over from scratch. It’s interesting to consider why video game adaptations struggle so much. A lot of the time, filmmakers seem to focus more on capitalizing on the game's popularity rather than capturing its essence. For example, the emotional depth and character development found in many games are often sacrificed for action-packed sequences or comedy, which can lead to a disjointed experience.</p>
        <p>Take "The Witcher" series as a counterpoint; while it's based on a game, it draws heavily from the source material in literature, resulting in a more coherent narrative. That balance between honoring the original source while creating a unique cinematic experience is crucial.</p>
        <p>Moreover, video games often thrive on player agency and immersive storytelling, two elements that can be challenging to translate to a passive medium like film. "Free Guy," for instance, tried to play with the concept of a game world, but it sometimes felt forced and didn’t explore the potential depth of its premise.</p>
        <p>I think if filmmakers were willing to take more risks and invest time in understanding what makes these games special, we could see much better adaptations in the future. Until then, it feels like we’re stuck in a cycle of missed opportunities.</p>
