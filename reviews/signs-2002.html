        <p>Who would have thought that a sci-fi thriller horror film could evoke such suspense and emotion? Director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to play with the audience's mind. Instead of following a conventional pattern or revealing the obvious, he takes a different approach and often does the unexpected. For instance, rather than using high-tech equipment, he has Morgan rely on Bo's old baby monitor, which adds a touch of creativity and realism. Furthermore, in the climactic moments of the film, without giving away any spoilers, he takes the audience by surprise, creating fear without needing to show much on screen.</p>
        <p>One of the film's strengths lies in its character development. Shyamalan invests time in building the relationships between the characters, allowing the audience to care deeply about their fates. This emotional investment amplifies the tension, as viewers are more affected by the outcomes of the characters they’ve come to understand. The performances, specifically, from Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, Rory Culkin, and Abigail Breslin are hauntingly strong, making the viewers feel every pang of fear and anxiety.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the atmospheric score plays a critical role in enhancing the film's unsettling tone. It weaves in and out of scenes, pulling viewers into the eerie world Shyamalan has crafted. The combination of sound and visuals creates a sense of dread that lingers long after the credits roll. The film wasn't initially supposed to have a score composed, but I'm glad it did because it's great.</p>
        <p>In essence, Shyamalan challenges the norms of the genre by blending elements of suspense, thrill, and emotional depth. This unique approach not only keeps the audience guessing but elevates the film to something truly remarkable that lingers in the mind, prompting reflections on both fear and the human experience.</p>
        <p>I believe this film is underrated, much like Tim Burton's <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/sleepy-hollow-1999.html" target="_self">Sleepy Hollow</a>, The issue is that many viewers approach both films with the wrong expectations. For instance, some might expect "Signs" to be similar to Steven Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind." It's important to remember that every filmmaker has their own unique vision, and their work shouldn't be harshly compared to other films. Here's an idea, try watching this film from a different approach and perspective. Who knows, you might actually enjoy it a lot more!</p>
