        <p>This was a film I wasn't looking forward to sitting down and watching. When I actually did find the time to do so, I realized how much I was correct because I disliked it.</p>
        <p>I expected this to be a desert horror type of film. Instead, we got a silly comedic desert adventure film. Normally, I tend to enjoy comedic films if done right. I couldn't find one thing that was funny in this film because this film tries too hard to be a parody of a desert horror adventure film. The script is too cheesy, and the acting is lazy. Overall, it's a plain awful attempt at an Indiana Jones wannabe.</p>
        <p>I did find Brendan Fraser, who plays Rick, to be quite enjoyable, but I felt like the writers tried too hard to make him like Indiana Jones. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn is also a solid choice to play a smart but extremely clumsy librarian. Fraser and Weisz's chemistry is also a highlight of this film. The action can also be fun, yet too drawn out at times.</p>
        <p>This Mummy is someone you can mess around with. It's terrifying not only because it's a Mummy, but the CGI is so bad that it makes me want to look away from the screen at times. This came out the same year as Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999), and that movie had way better CGI, yet people still bash George Lucas and his CGI.</p>
        <p>It's been 25 years, and this film is a cult classic, and I can see why. It's just not for me.</p>
        <p>People may criticize me for disliking this film, and say 'this guy hate comedy.' Well let me tell you this, your opinion doesn't matter.</p>
        <p>But seriously though, this is a level of comedy that I find cheesy; It's basically childish humor.</p>
