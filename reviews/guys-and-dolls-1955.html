        <h5>Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando in "Guys and Dolls (1955)."</h5>
        <p>As I said in my review of <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/sound-of-music-1965.html">The Sound of Music,</a> musicals weren't my thing. But that doesn't mean I avoid them. I've always wanted to watch "Guys and Dolls" mainly because of Marlon Brando. I'm not afraid to admit that I'm a big Marlon Brando fan, so I was excited to check this out. Going into this film, I knew, other than Brando, Frank Sinatra was also in this picture, and their feud, but more on that later, and how Brando sang all of his songs instead of having anyone dub over him.</p>
        <p>The lively musical picture "Guys and Dolls (1955)" is based in New York City and revolves around the lives of showgirls and gamblers. The narrative centers on the endearing Marlon Brando character Sky Masterson and the unwavering Frank Sinatra character Nathan Detroit. In an attempt to raise money for his floating crap game, Nathan bets Sky that he would be unable to get the devout missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go on a date. Despite living in very different worlds, Sky manages to succeed, and the two start to fall in love. Nathan's patient fiancée, Miss Adelaide (Vivian Blaine), is getting frustrated with their engagement after 14 years of courtship. The film delves into themes of love, fortune, and atonement, showcasing vibrant dance sequences and appealing tunes that animate the vibrant metropolis.</p>
        <p>I loved this picture. There's a sense of sweetness, charm, and innocence within scene after scene in "Guys and Dolls." This classic from the 1950s can truly take us back to a simpler time. Brando and Simmons are excellent and are the best parts of this film. Even though Brando can't really sing well, his acting is enough. Brando's acting can make up for the singing! He got the "singing" moves like singers do, but the voice isn't his strongest aspect. At least he tried! It was a different case with Christopher Plummer in "The Sound of Music." Unlike Brando, Plummer's voice was dubbed over when he sang "Edelweiss." Was it for the best? Perhaps. All I can say is that Brando tried. Speaking of Jean Simmons, her chemistry with Marlon Brando was perfect. They remind me of Liesel and Rolf from "The Sound of Music." The two best songs in this film are sung by both of them. "If I Were a Bell" and "Luck Be a Lady" are my favorites and what I consider to be the peak of this film.</p>
        <p>Despite these praises, I did have some issues with the film. Frank Sinatra was probably the weakest aspect of the film. He hardly does anything, and whenever he's in the film, he tones it down. Sinatra may have been a great singer, but he wasn't the greatest actor. His feud with Brando probably had something to do with his performance in this film. Sinatra reportedly hated Brando due to jealousy and his frustration with Brando's lack of a singing voice, even going as far as calling Brando the "world's most overrated actor." Brando fired back and made Sinatra eat so much cheesecake in the scene where Sinatra's character had to eat it. Since Sinatra hated cheesecake, this gave Brando an advantage. But I digress. Sinatra's performance did hurt the film, at least for me.</p>
        <p>Outside of the acting, story, and music, this film had really good sets, cinematography, and performances from all the side performers featured in the opening scene, the dance numbers featuring Miss Adelaide, and any bit when the group was singing. Those elements add to the comedic aspect of this film, other than its musical genre. The colorful and cheerful vibe this film provides can give newer generations a sense of what the '50s were like and why George Lucas and Robert Zemeckis are fans of this era, and why they included hints and references to the '50s in their films. This gave me a glimpse of how fun the '50s might've been.</p>
        <p>The sad thing is that not many people appreciate old Hollywood, but I have a soft spot for it. Just because something is old doesn't mean it's bad. Give it a chance and look at it without your spoiled perspective of the modern era we live in. Maybe you might find yourself enjoying an old and classic film.</p>
