        <p>This film is based on footage that was found after three film students disappeared in 1994 while exploring and looking for clues to make a documentary about the Blair Witch, a legendary local murderer. This idea does seem nice for a small project, but not for a theatrical release.</p>
        <p>I did like the atmosphere and premise of this movie, but I disliked the characters and outcome. None of these characters were interesting, they weren't developed nor did they have a purpose. At first, they all act fine together, but later on, they bitch and moan at each other. Why do all horror movies have this same issue when the main characters act so dumb? The film tried to build tension through conflicts among the characters, but instead of adding depth, it just made them more frustrating to watch. It often felt like they were making the same poor decisions you see in so many horror flicks, which took away from what could have been a more thrilling experience. I found myself hoping for some real character development, or at least a few smarter choices, but it never came. It’s a shame that a movie with such potential ends up relying on tired clichés and predictable behavior. I really wanted to root for them, but their lack of intelligence and growth made it impossible to invest in their fates. While the setting had much to offer, the character dynamics just fell flat for me.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I felt that the dialogue did little to enhance the characters or the overall story. Instead of engaging in conversations that could have revealed more about their backstories or motivations, the exchanges felt stilted and often forced. This lack of authentic interaction made it hard to relate to any of them and only added to my frustration as a viewer.</p>
        <p>The pacing of the film also contributed to my disappointment. Some stretches dragged on too long without meaningful action or character development, making it tedious to sit through. I found myself checking the time, wishing the momentum would pick up. When the climax finally arrived, it felt rushed and lacking in impact due to the poor foundation laid by the earlier segments. The fact that they didn't show the witch was a real disappointment. The film developed these ideas, yet only presented some hurried scenes, as I mentioned before.</p>
        <p>Even with an intriguing premise, the film's reliance on familiar horror tropes ultimately left me feeling unsatisfied. It could have taken bold risks or explored unique angles, but instead, it settled into a predictable formula. I wish more filmmakers would prioritize character depth and intelligent writing in horror, as these elements could elevate the genre and create a truly immersive experience. Overall, while the atmosphere had promise, the execution of the characters and plot left much to be desired.</p>
