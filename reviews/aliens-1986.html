        <p>In the '80s, we had "Star Wars," "Back to the Future," "The Terminator," and other great sci-fi films, that all got sequels, and of course <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/alien-1979.html" target="_self">Alien</a> was going to receive one. But instead of a sci-fi horror film, we got a sci-fi action film, and I thought it was an impressive idea to leave the horror element and stick to sci-fi and action, though not without a little horror as a nod to the first film. "Aliens" was not directed by Ridley Scott; instead, it was passed on to James Cameron, and he was able to put his stamp on the franchise with this sequel.</p>
        <p>Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) returns to the planet where her crew first encountered the hostile Alien species after losing contact with a human colony established there. Accompanied by a squad of Colonial Marines, Ripley discovers that the colony has been overrun by the terrifying creatures. As the team fights for survival, Ripley forms a protective bond with Newt, a young girl who is the sole survivor of the colony. The movie combines intense action with psychological horror, culminating in a showdown between Ripley and the formidable Alien Queen.</p>
        <p>As much as I enjoyed the story, the action, the other characters, and the actual alien itself, there was one part that resonated with me. What resonated with me was the character development of Ellen Ripley and her relationship with Newt (Carrie Henn). Newt was the little girl that was stuck on the ship after being separated from her family. Ripley had been gone in space for a long time, and her actual daughter passed away without getting to see her. Ripley makes up for her mistakes by making sure Jordan is safe and, most importantly, giving her a sense of hope. If you remember earlier in the film, Ripley was completely devastated by her daughter's passing and how guilty she felt because she hardly saw her.</p>
        <p>What makes this film scarier than the first is how the movie gives you feelings of unease, disquiet, and anxiety. "Aliens" is completely, horribly, and unwaveringly intense for at least the last hour. Weaver goes into fight to defend her coworkers, herself, and the small child, as the aliens fall from the ceiling, emerge from the floor, and crawl out of the ventilation shafts. This goes back to my point of James Cameron throwing in nods to the first film's horror element. The task given to director James Cameron was to create a gripping and terrifying thriller, and he succeeded. Weaver, who is on screen nearly constantly, gives a powerful, endearing performance; she serves as the glue holding everything together.</p>
        <p>Like <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/terminator2-1991.html" target="_self"> Terminator 2,</a> and <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/thegodfather2-1974.html" target="_self">The Godfather: Part 2</a> people consider those films to be better than the first. In the case of "Alien," many people consider it better than the first because "Aliens" offers more action, suspense, and emotional depth. The addition of a strong female lead in Ripley, a relatable protagonist, makes the story more engaging, whereas people prefer the horror that Ridley Scott provided in the first film. Either way, both films are equally loved by the fans and helped shape the genre of sci-fi. This is another one of those great sequels! 1986's "Aliens" is an exciting rollercoaster ride. It's got exciting action, creepy-looking aliens, guns, and a great mother-daughter relationship!</p>
