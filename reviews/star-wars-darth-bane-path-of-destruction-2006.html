        <p>Darth Bane.</p>
        <p>I want you to think for a second. Does that name sound familiar? Why yes, it should, because this was one of the most important Sith of all time. He was first mentioned in The Phantom Menace novelization by Terry Brooks. That little scene happens just before Darth Sidious talks to Darth Maul on Coruscant, and that information about the history of the Sith and Darth Bane all came from George Lucas himself.</p>
        <p>Seven years after the release of The Phantom Menace (film and novelization), author Drew Karpyshyn, who wrote the story for the Knights of the Old Republic video game, published the first novel in his highly acclaimed trilogy, "The Darth Bane Trilogy." In this trilogy, Karpyshyn explores the story of Darth Bane and his reign. This book, in particular, focuses on his origins while delving into the secrets and knowledge of the dark side.</p>
        <p>"Path of Destruction" is split into three parts. The first part focuses on Dessel (Bane)'s origins. The second part focuses on Bane's time at the academy, completely dropping the name, "Dessel," and using his Sith name, "Bane." The third part focuses on Bane's time out of the academy, the beginning of his reign, and his plan to reconstruct the Sith. We were aware that he did this, but we were unclear about the how and the when. The epilogue sets up the events of the next book, "Rule of Two."</p>
        <p>What I particularly enjoyed was the writing. Drew Karpyshyn knew how to engage his audience with such a fascinating character. I believe he took the right approach to this. He split the book into three parts, as I mentioned earlier, and told it like a classic Old Republic story. Karpyshyn took this approach to show the many faces of Darth Bane. That, I believe provided substantial development to his character, as this was one of the most significant characters in the Star Wars universe created by George Lucas himself.</p>
        <p>The novel houses some of the greatest moments in all of Star Wars, outside of the movies. Bane finds Revan's Holocron, Bane chooses his name, Bane's many duels, and many more. Gosh, this book has it all! It's hard to pick! Each twist and turn in the plot offers a deeper dive into the dark side of the Force, revealing Bane's complex character and his relentless ambition. The exploration of his philosophy about power and the Sith Legacy is thought-provoking, making you ponder the nature of strength and dominance.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the relationships Bane forms — both with allies and adversaries — are rich and layered. His interactions with other characters, like the enigmatic Zannah, (who appears in the Epilogue) add another layer of intrigue to the story. The challenges he faces and the choices he makes resonate well beyond the pages, echoing themes of ambition, betrayal, and the quest for immortality within the Sith order. Overall, it’s a gripping read that captures the essence of what makes Star Wars so compelling!</p>
        <p>This book is essential for anyone interested in the Expanded Universe. It offers everything you could want: a compelling character, an intriguing plot, thrilling action, well-developed supporting characters, captivating locations, and a profound exploration of the dark side. It's reminiscent of James Luceno's work in "Darth Plagueis."</p>
        <p>As a side note, if you're planning to read this novel for the first time, I highly recommend playing Knights of the Old Republic first, as this book contains many references to the game.</p>
