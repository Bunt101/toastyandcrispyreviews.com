        <p>That line was said by George Harrison, and I think that speaks volumes. I don't think anyone realizes how influential, intelligent, funny, and successful The Beatles were. Besides making music, these guys created movies, went on many tours, released albums, and built a large fanbase that still listens to their music today.</p>
        <p>Speaking of cinema, this movie is beautifully made, funny, catchy, and influential. It's a film that people of all ages can enjoy. Its vibrant colors are enough to brighten the world, showcasing the creativity that went into this film.</p>
        <p>Films like this, along with the music created by The Beatles, demonstrate their willingness to experiment and explore new musical forms. While they had a distinct style, each song on every album is unique and doesn't rely on the same melody repeatedly. The lyrics may seem simple at first glance, but they often convey deep and meaningful messages.</p>
        <p>The tale unfolds during a crisis in Pepperland, which has fallen under the attack of the Blue Meanies, who detest music. They are determined to undermine the influence of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, which has encouraged a vibrant "YES" to bloom near the bandstand, alongside a grand "LOVE" and an array of colorful decorations. In an effort to extinguish this joy, the Meanies drop blue bombs that drain the landscape of its colors, plunging Pepperland into a dull, gray stasis. Fortunately, Old Fred, the band’s conductor, manages to evade the Meanie's spell and escapes in the Yellow Submarine to rally the help of the Beatles.</p>
        <p>This is a film that can appeal to not only adults but to children as well. John Lennon once said, "I think it's a great movie, it's my favourite Beatle movie. Sean loves it now, all the little children love it." John was accurate with this statement. The colors, story, and villains are all lighthearted, colorful, and fun, which helps maintain children's attention.</p>
        <p>Initially, The Beatles weren't interested in being involved with the project, nor did they have the time for it. However, once they saw the film, they loved it and decided to make a special cameo other than using their music. In my opinion, their cameo is one of the best parts of the movie. I will not spoil it as much, but it feels like they're talking directly to you.</p>
        <p>"Yellow Submarine" remains one of the best Beatles movies, behind "A Hard Day's Night" and "Help!" The three titles are available in a DVD boxed set, which is a fitting collection and a must-have for any Beatles fan. Each title offers the same level of humor, quality music, and just enough of your four favorite lads from Liverpool.</p>
