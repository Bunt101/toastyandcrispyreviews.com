        <p>As children, even as young as babies, we fear even the smallest things. But we also get excited for the smallest things too. That's the great thing about being a kid. The idea of feeling care-free and not having to worry about many things. Our imaginations take over our mindsets with the toys and things we play and interact with, both in a sense of innocence and fear. It's unclear why our imaginations act the way they do, but it's something we just have to accept. Plus, it's the best thing about being a kid.</p>
        <p>The game, "Among the Sleep" takes that idea and turns it into a game. We play as a baby who just turned two years old and the game starts on its birthday party. The gender isn't mentioned, but apparently, some dialogue in the Italian version mention the baby as a girl, while the Czech version mentions the baby as a boy. Which that information, it's still hard to tell, but regardless, it's still a cute baby, even though we never see its face.</p>
        <p>During the birthday, someone knocks on the door and the mother (Cia Court) answers it. Judging from the dialogue, it's assumed to be the father. He's dropping off a gift for his kid, you. The mother isn't happy, but still takes the gift anyways. The mother later takes her kid up to his room to open up the present. It's a teddy bear which our character plays with and gets to know. It's a very curious little teddy bear with a great sense of wisdom and imagination. Yes, I said "wisdom," just because he asks about it doesn't mean he doesn't know it. After all, he is talking to a baby. After playing with Teddy (Roger Jackson), the mother returns after answering a phone call and puts the child to bed.</p>
        <p>The baby wakes up to find that Teddy has been taken away from someone or something. The baby wakes up to try to find Teddy. The baby finds Teddy and Teddy tells the baby to find the mother. So, you and Teddy head to the mother's room, only to find that she isn't there. Teddy suspects something happened to her. Naturally, the two of you begin the search. The first clue is a necklace, shown from a memory. That necklace is one of four memories to find out what really happened to the mother and why she went missing. Each level to locate the remaining three memories lead us to different locations with different puzzles. The puzzles are simple enough to solve and don't really take up time, but what does take up time is avoiding the monsters. These "monsters" are how the baby imagines his mother whenever he makes a mess: all big and scary.</p>
        <p>After you locate all the memories, you finally find your mother, but she tells you back away in a negative tone. This causes the baby to leave, while given the option to comfort her, to the front door, where a strange man is waiting. Which ends up being the father, who takes the kid with him, thus concluding the story of "Among the Sleep."</p>
        <p>This game was released in 2014 reciving positive reviews, which YouTubers like Markiplier starting a "Let's Play" series on YouTube channel. After it's sucess, the developers released the "enchanced edition" in 2017, three years after the original game released. The "enchanced edition" updated the textures, hardware, and performance. This "remaster" allowed the developers to release the game onto different platforms, even the Nintendo Switch.</p> 
        <p>The "enchanced edition" also includes the "prologue," which was DLC for the original game that explored a bit of the backstory and why the couple split and most importantly, not make the mother seem like the bad guy as both of the parents were at fault for not being able keep the relationship stable. Aside from the prologue, this revised version of the game includes a brand-new Museum Level with behind-the-scenes stuff and supplementary footage. It will also feature a digital artbook, a digital soundtrack, and - most importantly - the ability to switch between several sets of jammies in game. I won't spoil any of the behind-the-scenes stuff, that's for you to find that out for yourself.</p>
        <p>Regardless of which verison you play, "Among the Sleep" might just be one of the best horror games i've played. The plot is smart, the idea of playing a baby which creative and something that hasn't been done at all. The puzzles were simple enough to solve, "Teddy" is just amazing, and the monsters are pretty terrifying. I'm sure everyone has played "Among the Sleep" or watched "Let's Plays" of it, but if you haven't, go play it! It's worth the money.</p>
