        <p>No finer performance has been delivered by Harrison Ford than in this movie. Before this, he gained fame for his roles in George Lucas' films, including American Graffiti, Star Wars, and Indiana Jones, as well as other notable movies like Blade Runner. However, this film showcases Harrison Ford at his absolute best.</p>
        <p>"Witness" is more than just a movie; it's a work of art that leaves a lasting impression. The plot is compelling, the casting is perfect, the dialogue feels authentic, and the acting, chemistry, and atmosphere are all excellent. Additionally, Maurice Jarre's score is both subtle and emotionally impactful.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the casting, the romantic tension between John Book (Harrison Ford) and Rachel Lapp (Kelly McGillis) is simply delightful. You feel the emotional connection and desire between the two. At first, she sees him as a cop wasting their time, but warms up to him when she realizes everything her sister said about him was wrong. She sees him as a man who cares for the safety and well-being of others, especially Samuel, who is the most important thing to Rachel.</p>
        <p>Samuel, portrayed wonderfully by Lukas Haas, brings heart and curiosity to the film’s core. He's a smart kid with a strong personality, even if he's unaware of the modern world, but he certainly is a fast learner. His chemistry with Ford and McGillis is unmatched. It makes you wonder if Book would become his new father.</p>
        <p>Which leaves me to the ending. To avoid any spoilers, I have just one comment to make: I don't think any movie has ended on both a somber and a satisfying note. I understand why Book chose to leave, but leaving behind love is something people will regret for the rest of their lives. The final interaction he has with Samuel is perfect. There are no words, just the two sitting down, then as Book gets up, Samuel tells him goodbye. Later, Eli gives him a heads-up, which can be seen as advice. The most significant aspect of the ending is the final interaction between Book and Rachel. Their final interaction was physical. Their love was so strong that even saying goodbye was hard.</p>
        <p>As I stated earlier, this movie won't just play out for you; you will play it out. Movies like this provide a good yet somber experience, as Harrison's performance invites the audience to empathize, sympathize, root for him, and genuinely care, even for the other cast members, especially the actors who played Rachel, Samuel, and Eli.</p>
        <p>You'll be a Witness to this movie, but not what you'd expect.</p>
        <p></p>
