        <p>This and "A Hard Day's Night (1964)" perfectly depicts how much The Beatles were a huge thing. No matter how many years pass, people will still talk about The Beatles and their impact on music and pop culture. With this film, it's a lot of fun, humorous, and innocent. I laughed too hard when I watched both this and "A Hard Day's Night (1964)." It's highly recommended for any Beatle fan. Surprisingly, it still holds up even after 60 years.</p>
        <p>The energy and charisma of the band shine throughout, capturing the essence of the 1960s. The interactions between the band members feel genuine, emphasizing their friendship and chemistry, which is part of what makes this film so enjoyable. Additionally, the music is timeless; hearing iconic songs performed in such a lively context adds to the nostalgia. It’s not just a film; it’s a delightful glimpse into a pivotal moment in music history that continues to resonate with audiences today. Whether you're a lifelong fan or new to their music, this film is a joyful celebration of their legacy.</p>
        <p>Ringo Starr possesses a ring tied to a cult that signifies a required sacrifice. Oblivious to this fact, Ringo attracts numerous followers eager to steal his ring. Eventually, The Beatles consult a ring expert, but he is unable to help. They then turn to a scientist, who becomes intrigued by the ring and plots to take it from Ringo, resulting in him being pursued by two factions.</p>
        <p>The director, Richard Lester, known for "Superman II" and "Superman III" is a comedic director, who likes to play around with slapstick, and it works well here, but not in the "Superman" films he directed. The Beatles all have their time to shine and show us that these guys aren't just bandmates, but brothers. If you listen to Paul McCartney's interviews, he talks about how close they were together when they were in the band. It's great.</p>
        <p>Like I said, this is a funny film and a great one. It's highly recommended for Beatle fans. The humor is sharp, and filled with clever references, and the performances are top-notch. The film captures the spirit of the Beatles' music and their unique personalities, making it not just entertaining but also nostalgic. It's a wonderful trip down memory lane for anyone who appreciates their music, and even those who aren’t die-hard fans will find themselves laughing and tapping their feet. The soundtrack is also a highlight, showcasing some of their best hits in a way that enhances the story. Overall, it's a feel-good movie that leaves you smiling long after the credits roll!</p>

    <div class="rating">Rating: 4/4 stars.</div>
    <p></p>
    <p>To simply this review, I gave a reason for each star:</p>
        <p>The first star is for the story and jokes.</p>
        <p>The second star is for John's bed.</p>
        <p>The third star is for "The Exciting Adventure of Paul on the Floor," aka small Paul.</p>
        <p>The fourth star is for George jumping onto a car to save Ringo's life.</p>
        <p>Adding those numbers up makes this a great movie.</p>
    <p>One more thing: Thank you the inventor of the sewing machine.</p>
