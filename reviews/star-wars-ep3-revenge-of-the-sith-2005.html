        <p>Not to confuse anyone with the review of the film, this is a review of the novelization. My review of the film can be found on the "Movie-Reviews" page or by clicking here: <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-iii.html" target="_blank">The Phantom Menace</a></p>
        <p>This novelization exemplifies what a genuine novelization ought to be. While I adored the movie, I always thought the dialogue should have been better. I had memorized the movie and went into the novel knowing the story inside and out. And while reading, I was taken by surprise to see how well written this novel is.</p>
        <p>When given the instructions to create this book, George Lucas wanted the novelizations to be a different experience from the movie. Matthew Woodring Stover gave it his all, and the result is one of the best movie novelizations ever. Stover also made additions to the book. Not only the deleted sequences but also the extra dialogue and plenty more content!</p>
        <p>After reading this, my perspective of the movie changed wonderfully and spectacularly and for that, I have massive respect for Stover. He turned one of my favorite films into a beautiful novel. I will never look at the film the same way after reading this. Lucas created a masterpiece story and Stover enhanced it. You can tell from this novel is what George Lucas had in his mind, just in book form. This book enhances the movie and heightens the appeal of the narrative; thus, I heartily recommend it. This book enhanced my pleasure in the film by enhancing George Lucas' masterful plot.</p>
        <p>If you want an example of how well Matthew Stover understands George Lucas' vision, read this quote: “There is selfless love, and there is selfish love. There’s love that’s about you, and there’s love that’s about how I feel about you, and Anakin fails to make that distinction." - Matthew Stover. That's all i'm going to say.</p>
        <p>I even commented on Stover's post regarding the ROTS Novelization, and he liked my tweet, retweeted it, and commented. The image is below.</p>
