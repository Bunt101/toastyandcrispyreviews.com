        <p>The X-Men have emerged as iconic figures in superhero narratives, encompassing both cinematic and comic explorations. Before the advent of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the genre experienced several lackluster entries. Superhero movies could not be taken seriously anymore. A notable example comes from the poorly received film "Batman & Robin (1997)," which led to a widespread perception that superhero films lacked seriousness. However, this perception was significantly altered with the release of Bryan Singer's "X-Men," which revitalized interest in the genre.</p>
        <p>Typically, any movie not based on a novel receives a tie-in novel, and "X-Men" is one such example. The novelization of "X-Men" was written by Kristine Kathryn Rusch, author of "Star Wars: The New Rebellion (1996)." Rusch largely adheres to the movie's script, making only minor adjustments to the dialogue and scene transitions. This approach works well, suggesting that there is nothing wrong with the film itself.</p>
        <p>One significant change I want to highlight is the exploration of Scott Summers (Cyclops) and Ororo Munroe (Storm)'s origins. In the novel's prologue, after the introduction of Magneto in Poland, we transition to the backstories of Cyclops and Storm. This shift addresses a concern I raised in my review of the film, where I expressed disappointment over the minimal development of these two crucial characters. However, this novel enriches the narrative by delving into their histories, illustrating their personal journeys, challenges, and the flaws that shape them into the heroes they become. It’s refreshing to see their character arcs fleshed out, providing a deeper understanding of their motivations and evolution throughout the story.</p>
        <p>Apart from the aforementioned changes, there is limited content to discuss within this novel, as it largely serves as a retelling of the final shooting script of the film. This mirrors my previous critique of the novelization of "The Phantom Menace." Upon reviewing both novelizations, I was notably surprised to discover that there were no significant flaws in the films themselves. If the novelizations do not identify any issues, it suggests that the films are, indeed, satisfactory. Those films accomplished a great deal.</p>
