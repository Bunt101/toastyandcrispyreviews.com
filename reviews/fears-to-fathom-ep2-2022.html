        <p>This series was never meant to be a standalone. Rayll, the developer meant for this to be an episodic series, which each episode being based on a different story, told by actual people. It was only natural after the <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/fears-to-fathom-ep1-2021.html" target="_self">the first game</a>'s release, fans would send in their stories, hoping for theirs to be chosen. The story Rayll chose wasn't a situation being "home alone." He chose a story on a roadtip, which is the best way to describe it.</p>
        <p>This episode is centered around a young woman named Holly Gardner who is driving through a remote area when her car breaks down late at night. With no other options, she reluctantly accepts help from a passing stranger, who takes her to a near by motel, that is already unsettling, espeically when the owner asks Holly not to get the police invloved as it would damage the motal's reputation. As the night unfolds, Holly's situation grows increasingly tense, and she must navigate a series of unsettling encounters, culminating in a chilling finale where survival hinges on quick thinking and careful decision-making. The atmosphere is thick with suspense, making every interaction feel critical.</p>
        <p>Like I said preivously, the horror element doesn't come from the spooky atmosphere, or the jumpscares, it's the real-life stories. These are things you don't expect, or don't know what might happen, because with most horror films and video games, you can predict what might happen, but here, it's a real life story. That's the genius behind the formula of this game. This is a step-up from the first game. It's a longer experience, different settings, different characters, different story, and different outcome. Plus, there is a bit more new game mechanics. For example, the driving mechanics, making it more sophisticated than it's predecessor. Rather than a cutscene, Rayll decided to implement driving mechanics. Coding it in would just require the keys for the driving, and the mouselook.</p>
        <p>The game's style is predetermined, drawing inspiration from the claustrophobic B-horror VHS tape films of the 1980s. The same classic horror atmosphere will draw you right into the series. The idea that anyone could experience this—especially you—when paired with the realistic plot line makes for an engaging atmosphere that keeps you interested. The solution lies in certain deranged, disturbed persons and a strong reality factor—not in supernatural entities or monsters. It's all about people's anecdotal, grounded, and crowdsourced trauma stories. Since Unity was used to construct the game, it is likely that many more common assets will be used to create the in-game environment. Still, a lot of work and effort goes into the surroundings. The layout of the motel and petrol station is carefully thought out to create the ideal mood.</p>
        <p>I wish more horror games follow this formula of story telling. This series is refreshing from even the most exciting horror films of all time, as it is something no one has ever done before. This formula of story telling could also work for short films, but it would feel off without the interactive experience.</p>
