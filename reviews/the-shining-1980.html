        <p>This is considered by many as "peak horror." While I agree with the majority that it is one of the best, It isn't in favorites list. You may consider me a hypocrite for that statement due to my 4-star rating, but, you have to remember, my ratings of films vary from my favorites, not all films I give 4-stars are my favorites, no, there are some that between 3-3.5 stars, that are my favorites. "The Shining" is a great film, but not one of my favorites.</p>
        <p>"The Shining (1980)," directed by Stanley Kubrick, is a psychological horror masterpiece based on Stephen King's novel. Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, becomes the winter caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel, bringing his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny (Danny Lloyd), who possesses psychic abilities called "the shining." As the hotel’s sinister influence takes hold, Jack descends into madness, threatening his family. The tension builds to a chilling climax, with the Overlook's haunted history and Jack's unraveling psyche driving the family to the brink of destruction. The iconic film is renowned for its eerie atmosphere, memorable performances, and unforgettable imagery.</p>
        <p>Kubrick excels at establishing the horror element through visual imagery that suggests something is off about the hotel. Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance is outstanding; he brilliantly embodies the character's madness, making him truly iconic. I believe it was this role that led to interest in casting Nicholson as The Joker. His dialogue, physical acting, and vocal delivery are all genuinely terrifying.</p>
        <p>In addition to Nicholson's performance, the supporting cast, particularly Shelley Duvall as Wendy Torrance, adds another layer of complexity to the story. Duvall depicts Wendy's vulnerability and strength, making her the perfect counterpart to Jack's madness. Their dynamic further intensifies the film's emotional stakes and enhances the horror of their situation. I also felt really bad the way Kubrick treated her on set, it was horrible, but she did learn to forgive him and speaks fondly of him. To those who deny that Kubrick didn't treat Duvall well, you basically are also saying that Marlon Brando was a rapist and raped Maria Schiender without even looking at the facts, but instead mirror what Brando haters say.</p>
        <p>Overall, "The Shining" is a masterful blend of evocative imagery, compelling performances, and psychological tension, making it a timeless classic in the horror genre. The film's ability to unsettle and provoke thought long after the credits roll is a testament to Kubrick's brilliant direction and the outstanding talent of its cast.</p>
        <p>Stephen King, for the record, has said that although Kubrick's The Shining is visually stunning and full of memorable scenes, it is also "very cold" and doesn't really resemble the story he originally wrote about. He also said that the character of Wendy, whom he believed to be weak and foolish (and thus "misogynistic"), is not at all like the Wendy in the novel. When asked about Nicholson, King said, "I thought he did a wonderful job." Which goes to show that you can't go wrong with Nicholson. Any performance of his, no matter how bad the movie is, will always be a highlight.</p>
