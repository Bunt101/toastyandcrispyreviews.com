        <p>Batman Returns is the sequel to Batman (1989), directed by Tim Burton, that kinda follows the previous film. This is a much darker film that the previous one however there wasn't much improvement. The problem with Burton's Batman movies isn't the visuals or the villains; it's the lack of character development for Batman.</p>
        <p>The film opens with two parents abandoning their baby in the sewer, leaving their child to be raised by penguins. Which sounds fine, but it makes you realize how terrible some parents can be. This baby grows up to be The Penguin (Danny DeVito), a terrifying monster who eats anything and has blood dripping down his face. This shouldn't be a surprise, given the director of this film.<p>
        <p>Aside from The Penguin, there are also two other villains: Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Having two villains is fine, but three? That's pushing it a bit. At least the casting is good, so I can let it slide. Mostly. However, you did have McDonald's that screwed this film over by marketing everything for children when you literally had a midget having blood and mucus come out his mouth. Thanks, Tim Burton!<p>
        <p>Michael Keaton returns as millionaire Bruce Wayne/Batman with the greatest character introduction ever. Just staring into absolutely nothing! Then he looks up when the Bat Logo appears! It just goes to show how much Batman is nothing but some mysterious guy who saves people. More character development would've improved this film a whole lot more.<p>
        <p>In these movies, the villains are the main characters, and Batman is just the hero who swoops in and saves the day. In other words, it's just the typical "villain of the week" kind of story. Had Burton have his way with his third Batman film, I would've liked to see an origin story, or maybe even a film with more character development on the character whom the film is named after.</p>
        <p>I'm aware that I've come across as a Negative Nancy on this one, but I don't think the movie is all bad. Batman Returns still provides good entertainment nevertheless.<p>
