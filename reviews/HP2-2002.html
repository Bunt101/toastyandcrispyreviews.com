        <h5>Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)"</h5>
        <p></p>
        <p>Following the success of its predecessor, WB and J.K. Rowling allowed the series to continue. The first movie was the setup, and this was the payoff. I'm apparently one of the few people who actually enjoy "The Chamber of Secrets." I have no idea why people consider this the worst one. When in fact it's one of the best. In terms of how close this was to the book, it certainly follows the book just as well as the first. It just goes to show how much the director, Chris Columbus loves the source material.</p>
        <p>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his second year in this movie. Dobby, a house elf, warns Harry that he is in serious danger, but Harry is adamant about going back to school. Harry, along with his companions Ron Weasley (Robert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), arrive at Hogwarts to find that both students and animals are terrified of a string of unexplained attacks. There are rumors that the fabled Chamber of Secrets, a secret room purported to contain a dangerous creature, is behind these attacks. </p>
        <p>With the introduction of new characters like the conceited and inept Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) and This time, there are three new characters: a charming, a conceited, and a malicious one. Professor Sprout (Miriam Margolyes), is a biology faculty member. She offers a lesson on the unusual characteristics of the mandrake plant, which her John Donne pupils find particularly entertaining because they are aware of the extra symbolism that the mandrake is only partially mentioned in class. A deeper understanding of mandrakes makes Sprout's class funny. She is a welcome addition. Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) portrays the loveable, charming, and hilarious head of the Weasley family. then there is Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), father of the supercilious Draco, who skulks about as if he should be hated just on general principles.</p>
        <p>The movie goes deeper into the history of Hogwarts and the evil forces at work. In order to save his friends and confront the attacker, Harry must go to the Chamber of Secrets in the movie's climactic scene. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" is a beloved tale that follows Harry and his companions as they encounter the wonders and perils of the wizarding world. It has aspects of mystery, adventure, and magic. This movie's special effects are far superior than those in "The Philosopher/Sorcerer's Stone." This movie combines visual effects with realistic ones. It appears as though Dobby, Aragog, and the Basilisk have advanced in time since the first movie. You can tell that the special effects crew did a terrific job if the "follow the spiders" scene made you arachnophobic. I apologize as well; I found it a little uncomfortable to see.</p>
        <p>This film houses some of the best scenes in the whole film series. Tom Riddle (Christian Coulson)'s scenes are page-by-page perfect. Dumbledore's conversation with Harry, Dobby becoming a "freed elf," dueling club, Rupert Grint's hilarious physical acting, and my favorite, Hagrid comforting Hermione. That scene alone truly shows us what kind of person Hagrid is. Maybe that was Robbie Coltrane being himself instead of acting, but regardless, there was no Hogwarts without him. Robbie perfectly captured the sweet, gentleness, warmness, and fatherly figure Hagrid was in the books. It might be my favorite Hagrid scene in the whole Harry Potter film series.</p>
        <p>I've heard so many people say that this is the worst Harry Potter film, and if you think that, I'm sorry to say that the ability to speak doesn't make you intelligent. Have any of you seen David Yates' Harry Potter films? Those are nothing compared to "The Chamber of Secrets."</p>
