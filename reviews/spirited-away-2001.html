        <p>I'm not the biggest fan of anime, so I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. It does an excellent job of telling the story through animation. This movie can be enjoyed by those who love anime and by those who don't. I first watched this in 2015. I joined an anime club because a couple of my former friends told me to do so. This is the only movie I remember watching from that club, mostly because of how blown away I was. When the year was over, two things stuck in my mind from that club. This movie, and the counselor who was in charge of the club. He gave some great advice. He told me that if I wanted to learn a language, I should start off by listening. The more I listen, the more I'll understand, the more I understand, the more I can start speaking the language.</p>
        <p>"Spirited Away (2001)" follows Chihiro (Rumi Hiiragi), a young girl who stumbles into a mystical world ruled by spirits and gods while traveling with her parents. Her parents are transformed into pigs, and Chihiro must find a way to free them by working in a magical bathhouse run by the witch Yubaba (Mari Natsuki). Along the way, she befriends Haku (Miyu Irino), a mysterious boy who helps guide her. As Chihiro grows stronger and more independent, she uncovers secrets about Haku's past and her own identity.</p>
        <p>This movie not only tells a story, it creates a whole different world for us. There is always something happening within frame after frame. There's something about the animation style that speaks out in, not only art, but adventure. It explores different themes and genres. Kids may love the movie for it's relatible characters, but adults may appericate it more. I certainly appericate it more as an adult, more so than I did when I was kid, even a teenager.</p>
        <p>Hayao Miyazaki is not just a filmmaker; he's an artist. He's also sthe Japanese master who is a god to the Disney animators. Drawn in the tradition of the traditional Japanese graphic artists, Miyazaki's work is enjoyable to look at due to its realistic portrayal of fanciful aspects, rich detail, delicate color scheme, and crisp lines. Along with his characters' outward looks, he also suggests their inner selves. The movie "Spirited Away" is enjoyable to watch on its own, independent of the narrative and conversation.</p>
        <p>"Spirited Away" by Miyazaki has been likened to Alice in Wonderland, and rightfully so. It follows a 10-year-old girl as she ventures into a weird world inhabited by irrational laws. However, it has a decent heart and is charming and enjoyable in its own unique manner. If it's not one of the best movies, it's certainly a <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/great-movies.html" target="_self">great movie</a>. I know i'm sounding like a broken record, but come on, you'd be lying to yourself if you haven't called this a masterpiece over and over again. </p>
        <p>Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a visually stunning and poetic masterpiece, blending elements of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz. It takes viewers on an imaginative journey from innocence to experience without falling into typical kiddie-flick sentimentality. Filled with strange beings and painterly settings, it offers one of the most vibrant fantasy worlds, cementing its place as a landmark in animation.</p>
