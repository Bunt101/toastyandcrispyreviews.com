        <h5>Al Pacino and Marlon Brando in "The Godfather (1972)."</h5>
        <p></p>
        <p>When someone asks me what my top ten favorite films of all time are, "The Godfather (1972)" is up there on that list. This film is what made Francis Ford Coppola the director he is today. "The Godfather" is an adaption of the book, with the same title by Mario Puzo, who worked alongside Coppola to write the script and the casting. The film stars Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale. All perfect casting.</p>
        <p>The film starts out at the Corleone household. Don Vito Corleone (<a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/marlonbrando.html" target=_self>Marlon Brando</a>) is throwing a wedding party for his daughter, Connie Corleone (Talia Shire). Attending the wedding is Vito's youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who served as a decorated WWII Marine. It appears that Michael has little interest in working for the family company. Vito is a strong man who treats people with kindness when they show him respect but is brutal when they don't. However, Vito declines to comply when a strong and cunning opponent seeks to sell drugs and needs the Don's support to accomplish so. The conflict that ensues is between Vito's eroding traditional values and the modern ways, which could push Michael to take on a task for which he has always been reluctant: launch a mob war against all the other mafia families in an effort to destroy the Corleone family.</p>
        <p>I find it absolutely criminal that Al Pacino didn't win "Best Supporting Actor", despite his protest. And no, it wasn't against Marlon Brando. It was against the Academy. Regardless, I love the chemistry between Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and John Cazale. They truly felt like a real family. This is easily one of Marlon Brando's best roles, as well as Al Pacino's. They were born for these roles. Don Vito Corleone may be my favorite character, but Michael will always be a close second. This film perfectly presents us the start of his downfall. After losing Luca Brasi, Sonny Corleone, Apollonia Vitelli-Corleone, and Vito Corleone, things seem to take a dark turn for Michael. He was completely different then when he was in the beginning of the film. Nobody can pull this off except Al Pacino.</p>
        <p>What's more to say about this film? Nothing much. There's too much to talk about it, other than it is pure poetry. Only a few select people can direct films like this. Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, and Martin Scorsese I feel like are the three musketeers of crime-gangster films.</p>
        <p>Simply put, The Godfather film adaption by Francis Ford Coppola has grown to be such an iconic movie that anyone can see it again and not get tired of it.</p>
        <p></p>
