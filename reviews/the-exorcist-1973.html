        <p>During the time of writing this, we're in the middle of October, which people have dubbed, "the spooky season," and I decided to particate in that tradition in watching horror films. Thus began my hunt for great horror films recommended. This film was among many. I gave it a watch, and well, I'll let this review explain how I enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>The film starts out in the deserts of nothern Iraq, where Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) uncovers an ancient artifact resembling the demon Pazuzu during an archaeological dig. This discovery unsettles him, and eerie events begin to unfold, including a confrontation with a large statue of Pazuzu. The scene foreshadows the battle between good and evil, establishing Merrin's experience with demonic forces and setting the tone for the supernatural conflict that follows in the film. </p>
        <p>But the tale centers around a mother and her fourteen-year-old daughter. The mother's name is Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) and her daughter's name is Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair). They live a normal life until strange things beging happening to Regan. At first, Chris believes it's an illness, but when no doctors can cure her, Chris thinks something else is wrong. Chris then seeks the help of a local priest, Damien Karras (Jason Miller), who thinks the girl may be seized by the devil. The priest makes a request to perform an exorcism, and the church sends in an expert, Father Merrin to help with the difficult job.</p>
        <p>Chris, is like the audience. We don't know what is wrong with Regan and why she's acting oddly, levitating, speaking in tongues, even pissing on the ground. The movie builds up to the truth and climax pays off. Chris' reactions mirrior the audience's reactions. She's a character we can relate to, in terms of geninue fear and shock, even fustration when doctors and psychiatrists talk about lesions on the brain and she knows there's something deeper, more terrible, going on with Regan.</p>
        <p>This movie is scary, not because of the demon, but the suffering poor Regan suffers when this demon, maybe even the devil pocesses her. Her fear is the scarest aspect of it all, even when the head turns 360 degrees, which isn't normal. The use of special effects in the movie is superb. We are completely convinced, even in the face of the small child being possessed by the most repulsive spirits, the furniture flying, the bed pounding, and the vomit welling up. There are almost too many graphic shocks and profanities throughout the movie. It is astounding that a R grade was given for it rather than an X.</p>
        <p>The true genius of "The Exorcist" lies not just in the frightening demon that possesses Regan, but in the film's buildup and the suspense of what might happen next. The horror doesn't stem only from the demonic voice and appearance but also from the vulnerability of Regan, who is only 12 years old. Even 51 years later, the film and the trauma Regan endures are still scary!</p>
