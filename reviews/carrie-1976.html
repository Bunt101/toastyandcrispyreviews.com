        <p>Stephen King's first novel, Carrie, was published on April 5, 1974, and became a massive success. Two years later, director Brian De Palma adapted the book into a film, which also achieved great success. The success of both the novel and the film solidified King's status as a master of horror, paving the way for future adaptations of his work and contributing to the genre's popularity in the following decades.</p>
        <p>"Carrie (1976)," directed by Brian De Palma and based on Stephen King's novel, is a psychological horror film about Carrie White (Sissy Spacek), a shy, sheltered teenager tormented by her abusive, fanatically religious mother (Piper Laurie) and cruel classmates. After a humiliating prank at school, Carrie discovers she has telekinetic powers, which she begins to hone. When a kind classmate, Sue Snell (Amy Irving), persuades her boyfriend, Tommy Ross (William Katt), to take Carrie to prom as an act of kindness, Carrie experiences a brief moment of acceptance and joy. However, a cruel prank orchestrated by bullies leads to a horrifying climax, as Carrie's powers unleash a catastrophic wave of destruction, forever altering the lives of those around her. The film explores themes of bullying, repression, and revenge, blending chilling tension with a tragic narrative.</p>
        <p>Although it is slow at times, the tension and build-up are worth it in the end. The way the story unfolds allows for a deeper connection with the characters, making the climax all the more impactful. As the plot thickens, you find yourself fully immersed in the unfolding drama, eagerly anticipating each twist and turn. Ultimately, the payoff leaves a lasting impression, reminding us that sometimes the journey can be just as important as the destination.</p>
        <p>With Carrie, I just felt bad for her. Her mother was a terrible person who believed that even naturally, God created changes for humans were sinful.Like, what's wrong with a woman getting a period? Isn't that part of life? In religious terms, if God believed that was sinful, he would've have created that. People under 18 are raised mainly due to the household. Her mother was a terrible influence in her life, making her socially awkward, bullied, and crazy. When Carrie said that her father left, I said, "Well, no wonder." Carrie should've been with her father, but again, we don't know exactly who and what he was. In all honestly, Carrie should've lived with the gym teacher, she was a real one.</p>
        <p>The film not only solidified King's reputation as a master of horror but also introduced iconic performances, particularly that of Sissy Spacek as Carrie. The impact of both the novel and the film has been enduring, leading to numerous adaptations and homages in popular culture. Carrie's themes of alienation and empowerment continue to resonate with audiences, making it a timeless classic.</p>
