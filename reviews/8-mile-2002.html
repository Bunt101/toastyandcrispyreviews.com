        <p>The year was 2002, and it was a year for a lot of fun and exciting films. We got, "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/spider-man-2002.html" target="_self">Spider-Man</a>, <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-ii.html" target="_self">Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</a>, <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/HP2-2002.html" target="_self">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a>, "Spirited Away," and plenty of other films. It was a big year. But we also got a film called "8 Mile." This is a movie stars one of the greatest lyricist and rapper, Eminem.</p>
        <p>Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem), pale and depressed, skulks through a life that has been so harsh to him. His fiancée has gotten pregnant and broken up with him, and after doing the right thing by giving her his old car, he now faces the potential of moving back into his mother's trailer home with her boyfriend, who despises him. Jimmy carries his clothes in a trash bag. His employment is as a punch press operator.</p>
        <p>Outside of his crummy job, Rabbit (the nickname given to Jimmy Smith Jr.), attempts to do the one thing he excels at and enjoys doing. He's going to take the stage at the Shelter, a rap club that resembles a disused structure, and perform a hip-hop poetry slam. He's in the men's restroom, rehearses his lines, throws up and goes onto stage. But he fails, because he's nervous. He was given 45 seconds, but like I said, he was nervous. The seconds creep by in total silence, until Rabbit flees the stage and the Shelter.</p>
        <p>The film takes pieces of Eminem's life and uses it as the plot of this film. It's not an autobiography of his life. This is something that confuses people. So, I thought I'd clear that up. Anyways, throughout this whole film, Rabbit tries to overcome this stage fright that he has. Recognizing his own shortcomings is a sign of genius in Rabbit. Eminem takes a similar tack, admitting in his songs that he is a white man competing in a field dominated by black men. In "8 Mile's" pivotal performance sequence, he not only mocks his rival but also thwarts any potential retaliation by discrediting himself before he can. Tragically, he even refers to another rapper as "too generic" at one point. They have to read inner-city rock critics.</p>
        <p>Those elements were part of the reasons why I enjoyed the film, but there was one other element, Brittany Murphy, rest her soul. She plays a big role in this film. She's not only the love interest of Rabbit, but she's also a symbol of hope and escape for Eminem's character, B-Rabbit. She represented a better life beyond the trailer park and rap battles. The relationship is loyal if not faithful. But what makes the love story work is the performances and chemisty between Eminem and Brittany Murphy. They're able to build off each other and push each other. As well as not giving a damn about anything. Outside the film, the two were close friends, and her death still haunts Eminem to this day. Losing a close friend like that can be pretty haunting, especially since Murphy passed away when she was only 32.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of the film, Rabbit finally over comes his fear with the single greatest rap battle of history. If you've ever wondered where the idea of rap battles came from? Well, it was none other than this movie. This is one of the many films were the best scene is usually saved for last. The formula usually works when the whole movie builds up to it. If it doesn't, it will come off as unsatisfying. Building up to something like should be rewarding, not forced onto the average viewer.</p>
        <p>Eminem is a great rapper, no doubt about that, but I was surprised at how much of a good actor he is. He gave a great performance in this film, and it makes me wonder why he didn't continue to act in anymore films. But again, he's a rapper, and he's doing what he loves, so good for him! Brittany Murphy is also amazing, but I did have a problem with Kim Basinger. She hardly gave any effort as Rabbit's mom. I don't know if she saw this film as a quick paycheck, if she didn't like Eminem, or if she wasn't feeling well because she was going through a divorce from Alec Baldwin. I don't know, but she could've at least put in more effort. I understand that's how Eminem's mother was in real life, but Kim Basinger could've put in more effort. I saw some criticism that Kim Basinger is too gorgeous and glam to represent Rabbit's mother. Did people forget that appearance isn't always important? I've seen gorgeous women be the most awful individuals in the world. That shouldn't be interpreted as sexist.</p>
        <p>Overall, "8 Mile" is a very engaging film, featuring a captivating story, endearing characters, fun environment, memorable scenes, and songs. And of course, the amazing conclusion that everyone speaks about. It's one of the best films released in 2002. This is a good standalone film, but a sequel would've been nice to have seen. Or maybe a different story, but with the same characters.</p>
