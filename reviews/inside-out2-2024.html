            <p>We are currently in the age of remakes, pointless sequels, and overall just bad movies, with a few exceptions. I was pleasantly surprised by 2024's "Inside Out 2." Normally, with sequels, I don't have high hopes, but as I said, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. Much like the first film, it does a great job with the story, characters, morals, and atmosphere. This is one of the rare times when the sequel can be just as good as the first.</p>
            <p>Riley (Kensington Tallman) is going through the early stages of puberty, and this gives a great moral to children that people change when they hit puberty, and that's something they cannot change. However, your choices can determine the kind of person you are. The way they wrote Riley perfectly represents what one goes through during puberty. During those times, people will experience a wide range of emotions. Like all people who go through puberty, Riley tries not to like herself just so she can fit in with other people. As an adult, I appreciate Pixar's approach to this topic. It's a difficult subject to cover without being creepy. Approaching this from the mental and emotional aspect was a smart decision. It's simple to understand without confusing anyone, especially kids. The story explores the complexities of growing up and the inevitability of change, highlighting the importance of self-acceptance and the impact of choices on personal development​.</p>
            <p>Puberty probably wasn't the best experience in life, but it certainly became something to look back upon and feel relieved that it's all over. With Pixar's approach to this subject, for us adults, it can be a trip down memory lane or a learning tool if we ever need to give the "talk" to our kids or anyone else. But if you aren't up for the challenge, just show them this film. It covers the topic quite nicely and also provides a good story on top of that.</p>
            <p>Other than the usual gang, which includes Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, we are introduced to new characters that act as the emotions introduced to us during puberty. Those characters are Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, Nostalgia, and Ennui. Without much character development, we can already identify and understand what kind of characters they are. I can understand why people may dislike Anxiety because it's an emotion that we can all relate to. The character is fine; it's just that emotion can be difficult to deal with, especially during our teenage years. This influx of new emotions challenges the established order within Riley's mind, leading to a mix of humorous and poignant moments as she learns to cope with the changes in her life.</p>
            <p>If Pixar were to make a third film, I think the story should feature Riley all grown up, graduating high school, and going off to college, similar to how Andy was written in "Toy Story 3." Why do I think this is a good choice? Well, I'll tell you. Looking at the films we have now: the first film focuses on Riley when she's only a little girl in school. This film makes Riley a teenager who's going through the early stages of puberty and is about to start high school. So, making her an adult will only be natural and fit into this style. Should there be new characters? Maybe, but nothing creepy. Plus, it can make kids who are the same age as Riley feel relatable.</p>
            <p>"Inside Out 2" can be considered a better sequel than "Finding Dory" and "The Incredibles 2." If not better, it's at least as good as those two. Pixar films never fail to impress, unless done wrong. Can it be considered the best of the year? Doubtful, but it could be considered the best-animated film of the year. I know for a fact that "Despicable Me 4 (2024)" won't be on that list, so there may be a good chance.</p>
