        <p>Because Anakin Skywalker is one of my favorite Star Wars characters, I was eager to read this book. Although it was not the best book I've ever read, it was undoubtedly enjoyable and a good read. The authors, David Sherman and Dan Cragg, have a wealth of military and combat experience, and it is clear from their writing. I thought Sherman and Cragg accurately captured George Lucas' vision when they wrote Anakin Skywalker in this book. The friendship between Anakin Skywalker and Nejaa Halcyon was one of my favorites. They appeared to get along well with one another and make a terrific team.</p>
        <p>Overall, this is a fun action novel. Although it's forgettable and a bit weak, it's still a fun read. It also builds up Anakin's character. I apologize for the short review. There's nothing much to talk about in this novel.</p>
