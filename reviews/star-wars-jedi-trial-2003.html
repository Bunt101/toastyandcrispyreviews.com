        <p>"Jedi Trial" is considered one of the weakest Clone Wars novels within the Star Wars Expanded Universe, so I didn't have high hopes when going into this novel, but to my surprise, I found myself enjoying this novel.</p>
        <p>Because Anakin Skywalker is one of my favorite Star Wars characters, I was eager to read this book. Although it was not the best book I've ever read, it was undoubtedly enjoyable and a good read. The authors, David Sherman and Dan Cragg have a wealth of military and combat experience, and it is clear from their writing. I thought Sherman and Cragg accurately captured George Lucas' vision when they wrote Anakin Skywalker in this book. The friendship between Anakin Skywalker and Nejaa Halcyon was one of my favorites. They appeared to get along well with one another and make a terrific team. Both Skywalker and Halcyon are quite similar in that they are both adept with light saber battle, are repressed by the council, and have a similar secret—that is, Anakin is married to Padmé and Nejaa is married and has a kid. I think it's because of those facts that they became close and became friends. Rather than Palpatine, Anakin needed Nejaa Halcyon in his life.</p>
        <p>The book also introduces us to Odie and Erk, two soldiers in the Galatic Republic. They had a wonderful dynamic and provided a decent soldier's perspective in addition to being a fantastic "couple." Their journey is quite stressful throughout the novel. I think Sherman and Cragg's military experience helped serve this novel in terms of the military, war, and soldier perspective. Probably that's why LucasFilm called these guys in to write this novel, even if it didn't do as well as the other novels. They're no James Luceno, Timothy Zahn, or Matthew Stover, but they are certainly some good authors for this kind of genre.</p>
        <p>One issue with every book I've read about the Clone Wars era (except Travis's Commando books) is that they don't include any clones. Similar to every other book, the Clones don't seem to be that significant—beyond being used as just soldiers under orders—and instead, other characters get the characterization. Maybe ever since The Clone Wars (2008-2020) series gave depth to the Clones, but I wish some of the book's characters were replaced with Clones and given more depth, other than briefly giving Cody a bit of page time.</p>
        <p>Overall, this is a fun action novel. Although it's forgettable and a bit weak, it's still a fun read. It also builds up Anakin's character. I don't understand the hate for this novel. It's one of the good, not great, or excellent, just a good novel. Also, why photoshop a still of Anakin's Episode III look over his Padawan outfit? That's his haircut after being Knighted. Anakin was still a padawan, and even said throughout that he's eagerly awaiting the trials.</p>
