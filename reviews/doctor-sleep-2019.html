        <p>"Doctor Sleep (2019)," directed by Mike Flanagan, is a sequel to The Shining that follows an adult Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor) as he grapples with his traumatic past and his psychic abilities, known as "the shining." Now struggling with alcoholism, Danny finds new purpose when he forms a bond with Abra (Kyliegh Curran), a young girl with powerful shining abilities. Together, they face off against a cult called the True Knot, led by the sinister Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson), who feeds on the life force of those with the shining to achieve immortality. The film explores themes of redemption and legacy, culminating in a haunting return to the Overlook Hotel, where Danny must confront both external threats and the lingering demons of his childhood.</p>
        <p>I'd safely say this is a well made and a thoughtful sequel to the Kubrick film, while adapting the book at the same time. Although it is a longer film that takes time to set things up, I still found it enjoyable. In this case, the performances overshadow the story, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. My only complaint is that the ending relies too heavily on nostalgia and the original Kubrick film. I guess cause since it was a sequel to that film, it had to connect it in some way.</p>
        <p>Ewan McGregor's performance is easily the best performance in this movie. Danny hasn't had the best life, and it shows. Watch "The Shining" to understand why. Even with all of that, he remains a nice guy and very helpful, completely different than his father. His chemistry with Kyliegh Curran is another highlight. They both are similar characters, and they bounce off each other in many ways, making it easily some of the best moments from the film.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the cinematography and visual effects were impressive, contributing to the overall atmosphere and tension of the movie. The character development was another strong point, as it added depth and complexity to the narrative. I appreciated how the film explored themes of memory and trauma, giving it a more profound emotional resonance. However, some viewers might find the pacing slow, especially in the first half. Still, the payoff in terms of character arcs and emotional moments made it worthwhile for me. Overall, this sequel successfully honors its predecessor while carving out its own identity, making it a worthy addition to the cinematic landscape.</p>
        <p>Stephen King disliked Kubrick's adaption of "The Shining" but enjoyed this sequel a lot more, which is a huge plus. While I still do enjoy the Kubrick film, I did feel like it did lack some of the things from the original novel, hence King's dissatisfaction. Jack Nicholson still remains the best part about that movie and I really wish Jack Nicholson came back to reprise his role, or even cameo, that would've fans losing their minds.</p>
