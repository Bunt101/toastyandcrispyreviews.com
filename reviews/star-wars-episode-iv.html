        <p>This was the film that changed the game. Movies were never the same after "Star Wars." It spawned a generation of fans, lovers, and praisers. After the success of "American Graffiti," George Lucas had the idea for two films, "Star Wars" and "Indiana Jones." But Lucas wanted to focus more on Star Wars and save Indiana Jones for later. And thus, Star Wars was born.</p>
        <p>The story starts off with the Rebels claiming victory, finally stealing the Death Star plans. However, their celebration was short-lived, as the Empire was hot on their tail. That opening scene blew everyone out of their seats; no other movie had done that before. The Rebels are being pursued by Darth Vader (David Prowse), who successfully captures the Rebel Blockade Runner, also known as the Tantive IV. But, what he didn't know, is that Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) has hidden the plans in her droid, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), with a message to an old Jedi named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). While Leia is captured by Darth Vader, R2-D2, along with his friend C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), takes an escape pod to the planet below, Tatooine, to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. They get captured by Jawas to be sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown), who has a nephew named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). After purchasing the droids, Luke accidentally triggers Leia's message and becomes curious, which leads to R2-D2 wandering off to find Obi-Wan. While looking for Kenobi, Tusken Raiders attack Luke, but he is saved by Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan takes Luke back to his hut and plays the message, asking Luke to help him. The two find a pilot named Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who agrees to take them to Alderaan, only to find out it has been destroyed by Darth Vader. Their next mission is to save Leia and deliver the plans to the Rebel Alliance. After rescuing Leia, the team escapes to the Rebel Base and plans their final assault to destroy the Death Star.</p>
        <p>This film is beautiful, revolutionary, magical, and fun. No other film can top George Lucas' masterpiece. Even though the film was a success, it had a troubled production history. The script had been re-written at least four times, the sets, props, and special effects weren't working right, there were constant clashes between Lucas and the crew, and many other issues. This put a lot of stress on George Lucas. Eventually, it reached a point where Lucas felt sharp chest pain, so he checked into a local hospital only to find out that he suffered from stress-induced hypertension. The doctor told him to ease off his stress, or it could kill him. But Lucas was determined to finish the project, whether or not it was good. Little did he know, the film would be a success. He found out while he was on vacation with his ex-wife, Marcia Lucas. As a result of this film, he never wanted to direct again, as it almost killed him. This is why he brought in Irvin Kershner to direct "Empire" and Richard Marquand for "Jedi." Lucas also hoped someone would help direct the prequels with him, but nobody was interested or they were scared.</p>
        <p>There is a lot to like about this film. The opening shot, as I mentioned, blew people away. The special effects were like none other. Those were all done by Industrial Light and Magic. Since there were no special effects companies around the time of "A New Hope," Lucas created his own. The costume design, John Williams' score, John Barry's set design, Marcia Lucas, Paul Hirsch, and Richard Chew's editing, Ben Burtt's sound design, the acting, and the references to ancient mythology and old movies are other key things to take away from this film.</p>
        <p>This remains a true Star Wars film, all things under George Lucas are, and no one can tell me otherwise. This isn't my favorite Star Wars movie, it's my third favorite, behind "The Empire Strikes Back" and <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-iii.html" target="_self">Revenge of the Sith</a>. Here's a debate that people always get themselves into, what order should a new fan watch The Star Wars movies? Most people say watch it the order it was released, Original Trilogy then Prequel Trilogy, but others say in chronological order. Most people say watch it in the order it was released, Original Trilogy then Prequel Trilogy, but others say in chronological order. I'd suggest if this is your first experience, watch the Original Trilogy and then the Prequel Trilogy. After that, the Prequel Trilogy then the Original Trilogy.</p>
        <p>Regardless, "Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope" remains as a film with significant influence. A film that has revolutionized filmmaking. A film that all people can enjoy. All of this wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for Mr. Lucas' brilliant and artistic mind. "Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" is a fun roller-coaster ride from beginning to end.</p>
