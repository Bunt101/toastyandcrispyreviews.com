        <p>In 1966, a little science fiction show called "Star Trek" aired on NBC. Gene Roddenberry created it, and it quickly gained popularity, developing a large fanbase that included both dedicated fans and casual viewers.</p>
        <p>I wasn't a Star Trek fan as a kid. I was aware of the show and had seen a few episodes on TV. My father was the one who told me about the series. He wasn't a Trekkie; he did watch the series in the '60s. I don't remember much about what he said, but I do remember Spock and Captain Kirk. Eventually, I decided to watch the original motion picture film series.</p>
        <p>In 2023, I visited Dollar Tree and came across their DVD section. They had the 2009 DVD release of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It was the theatrical cut, which I wasn't aware of at the time. So, I decided to buy it and try getting into the series. Plus, I read that Robert Wise directed it. He was responsible for one of my all-time favorite movies, "The Sound of Music," so I had high hopes for this project. However, as I watched it, I found it slow, rough, and messy. So, I put the film down and never touched it again.</p>
        <p>Two years later, I recently decided to give it a second chance. I realized I had been too harsh on it.</p>
        <p>I did some research to understand why I felt this way and discovered that the theatrical cut of the film was rushed. This was largely due to Michael Eisner, who was the president of Paramount at the time. He pushed for the film to be released on December 9, 1979. Robert Wise always said that the theatrical cut wasn't the film he wanted to make. He often considered it a workprint. Which, looking back, I see what he means.</p>
        <p>Originally, the plan was to make a second series, called "Star Trek: Phase II." When <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/star-wars-episode-iv.html" target="_self">Star Wars</a> was released in May 1977, science fiction had regained its popularity. Close Encounters of the Third Kind also contributed to this resurgence in the genre. Eisner wanted a film instead.</p>
        <p>For many years, Robert Wise often disregarded the film and disowned it. It changed his reputation significantly. Fortunately, about 20 years later, Paramount gave him a second chance and allowed him to recut the film the way he had originally intended.</p>
        <p>When I decided to give the series a second chance, I went hunting for the 2001 DVD of the Director's Edition- the version Wise wanted everyone to see, because I wanted to know how the film was meant to be, instead of the theatrical cut. To my surprise, I was astonished by how much I enjoyed it. When the movie ended, I said to it, "Oh, how was I wrong about you!"</p>
        <p>In my review of the theatrical cut, I mentioned that the film was slow, rough, and confusing, while appreciating the set design, costumes, visual effects, the cinematography, the original cast's return, and Jerry Goldsmith's score. In the Director's Edition, however, all my praise remains the same, while the complaints have improved.</p>
        <p>In this version, Wise and his team fixed several pacing issues, improved scene transitions, enhanced special effects, and restructured the film. The Director's Edition adds 5 minutes of footage, which significantly aids the story. Sure, it still feels a bit slow, but that's the genius behind it. The way I see it is Wise familiarizing everyone with the world, while also reminding the fans, "This is the stuff you liked, but on the big screen!"</p>
        <p>While most of my complaints have been fixed in this version, I still have a few issues with the movie, specifically the dialogue and some of the delivery. During production, the script was being rewritten, which didn't give the actors much time to rehearse. That's why they often sound like obedient employees of NASA, following orders like soldiers. Then again, I can't really blame the actors for their delivery when their lines were presented to them on the day of filming.</p>
        <p>That being said, I love the cast of this movie. Everyone feels right, in place, and captures what they did in the original series. I also liked the new characters, like Ilia and Decker. They're fascinating and well cast. It's said they had a history together when Decker was stationed on her planet. If this detail slipped past your head, you can tell by the little moments these actors share whenever they're on screen. Whether they smile, look, or talk to each other, their interactions reveal a shared history and chemistry.</p>
        <p>The writing of each character was much better than the dialogue, in my opinion. In case you were wondering, Spock is my favorite character. 🖖🏻</p>
        <p>The score was written, composed, and conducted by the late Jerry Goldsmith. Just as John Williams gave Star Wars and Superman an identity, Goldsmith gave Star Trek an identity. Even fans of the show say they prefer Goldsmith's score, while enjoying the original series' theme. Which I agree with. I would explain why, but I'd be here forever.</p>
        <p>After giving the series a second chance by watching the Director's Edition, it was probably one of the few good decisions I made in my life. Watching this version made me fall in love with the series. After watching the director's edition, I started searching for the rest of the films on DVD. Probably some of the best investments in my life.</p>
        <p>Overall, Star Trek: The Motion Picture - The Director's Edition may not be the best Star Trek film, but it is certainly one of the most beautiful-looking movies of all time. This is Robert Wise in a nutshell. He was a perfectionist. He ensured that all of his movies were visually appealing. I feel like this is the most technically impressive one in the series. It's not my favorite, but it's one I can rewatch more than once.</p>
        <p>Now to find the 2022 cut of the film, so I can let my eyes drink all the beautiful visuals.</p>
