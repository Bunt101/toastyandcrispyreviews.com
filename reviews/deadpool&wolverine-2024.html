        <p>I was lucky enough to catch "Deadpool and Wolverine (2024)" a day early, before its release. I've never done this before, but it probably had something to do with the hype.</p> 
        <p>Ever since "Deadpool (2016)" was released in cinemas, fans were dreaming of the time when Deadpool and Wolverine would collab. Marvel made the dream come true with the release of "Deadpool and Wolverine (2024)." However, people seem to forget that these two, Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds starred together as their characters in the terrible Wolverine origin film, <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/x-men-origins-wolverine-2009.html" target="_self">X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</a> At the same time, though, I can see why people might forget that as that film was terrible. At least this was an improvement, I guess.</a></p>
        <p>The plot begins with Deadpool's trademark wisecracks and meta-commentary, setting the tone for a film that doesn't take itself too seriously. When a new enemy with the capacity to manipulate time threatens the entire fabric of reality, Deadpool realizes he is in over his head and seeks Wolverine's help. Despite their initial resistance, the two forge an uneasy friendship, punctuated by Wolverine's stern approach and Deadpool's unrelenting wit. Along the journey, they meet surprising allies and opponents, including Cable, who makes a surprise cameo, adding to the film's complex dynamic. A critical moment happens when Deadpool's impulsiveness causes a tragic incident, forcing him to confront his own flaws. The climactic confrontation pits Wolverine's ruthless combat abilities against Deadpool's inventive and reckless tactics, resulting in a visually stunning showdown. The film balances action, humor, and a touch of poignancy, ultimately celebrating the unlikely friendship between its two leads.</p>
        <p>What I found entertaining was the return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, the many cameos, the acting, most of the dialogue, Wolverine and Deadpool's friendship, and the amount of absurdity this film offers. This was a nice and refreshing take on the MCU, rather than all of those horrible forced woke nonsensical projects that Disney has been shoving down our throats for the past five years. Also, that Wolverine costume was a chef's kiss. Seeing Hugh Jackman in it was a nice nod to the comics. Speaking of Hugh Jackman, it was nice to get a bunch of references from past X-Men films, even "Logan (2017)." There's a scene I enjoyed a lot where X-23, Laura (Dafne Keen), talks with Logan and gives him a pep talk, which helps with his character development. Logan may be cold and harsh, but he still has a heart.</p>
        <p>You may have noticed that I didn't mention my liking of the plot. Well, that's because I didn't really care much for the plot. The problem with movies these days is that nobody cares about the story. Instead, they care for the mindless action, cheesy dialogue, forced woke culture, and the pleasure of ridiculous fanbases. This is my main problem with MCU films, and films in general. It's hard to find a film with a great plot. I would like a film where I can say, "Ah, this is nice, let's keep on going." But that isn't the worst thing a film can do for me. The worst a film can do is bore me, and did "Deadpool and Wolverine" bore me? Absolutely not. It's one of the few films of the year that I actually enjoyed.</p>
        <p>I digress. In no way is "Deadpool and Wolverine" a bad film. In fact, the film is still good and a possible comeback for the MCU. It's a mindless, fun, and exciting film in which the story takes the backseat. Instead, the film focuses on the action, dialogue, and enormous and ridiculous fanbase.</p>
