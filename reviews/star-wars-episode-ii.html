        <p>After the mixed reception of The Phantom Menace, everyone thought it was a fluke and Lucas would have learned from his mistakes. Reluctantly, I hate to say that it's not much of an improvement. In my opinion, The Phantom Menace is a much better film.</p>
        <p>The film opens with a failed assassination attempt against the former Queen of Naboo, now Senator of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, played by Natalie Portman, who demands answers. Our two main leads, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice, the all-grown-up Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), are sent to protect her.</p>
        <p>The film features both an A and a B plot. The A plot revolves around Anakin and Padmé's love story, while the B plot follows Obi-Wan as he plays detective. These plots eventually converge in an exciting third act.</p>
        <p>This was the first Star Wars film to be filmed with digital cameras, and that's an oustanding achievement in filmmaking, and half of the film is CGI. Which can seem a little rough by today's standards, but it's still a great stepping stone into modern filmmaking.</p>
        <p>The film suffers in several areas. The dialogue is somehow worse than in the last movie. I can't solely blame Jonathan Hales or George Lucas; Rick McCallum deserves most of the blame for rushing everything. The acting doesn't quite work in the romance story; both Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen needed better performances and more effort when sharing scenes. Surprisingly, whenever they're not on screen together, they give good performances.</p>
        <p>While this may be considered the weakest of the six Star Wars films created by George Lucas, it's not necessarily a terrible film. Many elements are at play here, both in a technical standpoint and in terms of fan engagement.</p>
        <div class="rating">Rating: 3/4 stars.</div>
