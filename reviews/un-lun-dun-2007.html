        <p>This book was incredibly strange but entertaining. Yet, I typically feel that way after reading books like these. I mean, looking at the author, China Miéville, he's known for more adult novels with more serious genres. For a project in my sophomore year of high school, I read this book. And as I've already mentioned, I wasn't expecting to enjoy reading this.</p>
        <p>The story is set in UnLondon, an alternate city beneath London filled with strange creatures and bizarre landscapes. The protagonist, Zanna, discovers she is the "Shwazzy" or "Chosen One" destined to save UnLondon from the evil Smog. However, when Zanna is incapacitated, her friend Deeba unexpectedly takes up the mantle. Deeba embarks on an adventurous journey through UnLondon, encountering quirky characters and overcoming various challenges to confront the Smog and save the city.</p>
        <p>This has always struck me as a sort of contemporary Alice in Wonderland. Stories like that might also be successful if they are written properly. And I commend China Miéville for it. This also caught me off guard because I never thought he would pen a children's book.</p>

        <div class="rating">Rating: 3/4 stars.</div>
