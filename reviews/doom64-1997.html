        <p>Midway created the first-person shooting game Doom 64. It was the second Doom spin-off game after Final Doom (1996) and the fourth game in the series overall when it was first released on the Nintendo 64 in 1997. Nightdive Studios worked on a remastered port, which Bethesda Softworks released in March 2020 for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, and in May 2020 for Stadia.</p>
        <p>"Doom 64 (1997)" is a first-person shooter where players reprise the role of the Doom Marine, tasked with stopping a demonic invasion. Set after the events of the original "Doom" games, the protagonist returns to a UAC research facility on Mars, now overrun by demons. Players navigate through dark, atmospheric levels filled with deadly enemies and challenging puzzles. The ultimate goal is to prevent the demons from invading Earth by confronting the Mother Demon, a new and formidable foe.</p>
        <p>This game is a lot of fun, and it is styled similarly to the earlier games. It must have been enjoyable to play on the N64, but using that controller requires a lot of hands. As previously stated, "Doom 64" offers a distinct and captivating experience within the renowned series. It is possible to play the classic game on contemporary hardware with improved graphics and a melancholic soundtrack. It is simple to locate a digital copy on platforms such as Steam.</p>
