        <p>While messing around one day on my Meta Quest 2, I headed to the Meta Quest store to search for a new game to try. I ended up stumbling across "The 7th Guest VR," and saw there was a free 20 minute free-trial. That sparked my curiousty, so I tried it out. Within 20 minutes, I was able to understand the premise of the game, but got disapointed when my 20 minutes was over. Normally, I would wait for a deal or a discount, but my gut was telling me to buy it immediately, which I did. Thus began my journey.</p>
        <p>The game starts out with you, the main protagonist, rowing a boat to an island which has a giant mansion, which belongs to "The Toymaker." Upon arrival, a voice greats you, that voice is a little boy, named Tad (Jonah Bromley), who was the 7th Guest. He can't seem to remember what has happened what happened while he was at the house, so it's up to you, the player, to help him out. As your go through the house, more and more do you learn about the events that transpired.</p>
        <p>Henry Stauf, The Toymaker (Carl Wharton), invites 6 guests to his mansion. There, he makes a deal, if they bring him a boy, then he'll grant their deepest heart's desire. This causes the guests to go crazy, which is exactly what The Toymaker wants. But like I said, this isn't all revealed to you at once, it's revealed once you complete a room's puzzles. The mansion features numerous rooms, each tied to unique puzzles. These puzzles unlock access to other parts of the house, allowing for gradual exploration and story progression.</p>
        <p>Each puzzle is unique and challenging. This is by design, because it is staying true to the spirit of the original game while incorporating VR-specific mechanics. The puzzles grow progressively more difficult as you advance, adding to the suspense and satisfaction of unraveling the mansion’s mysteries. The VR format enhances this by allowing you to physically interact with objects, creating a hands-on experience that deepens the connection to the gameplay.</p>
        <p>The game's big feature is the lantern. It is somewhat similar to a UV light in concept but with a distinct twist. When you shine the lantern on objects or areas, it transforms them back to their original, pristine state, temporarily revealing the mansion's former glory. This mechanic not only helps players uncover hidden details and immerse themselves in the narrative but also emphasizes the haunting duality of the decayed and restored environment. The light mechanic adds to the eerie atmosphere, enhancing exploration by making the mansion feel alive, as if it is both preserving and concealing its secrets. It's not used for uncovering stains or evidence like a typical UV light but instead creates a visual contrast that deepens the game's mystery and storytelling.</p>
        <p>This is the kind of VR games I like. VR games that explore different worlds, have a story, and puzzle solving. I'm not a big fan of FPS VR, or mulitplayer games on the VR. I find those game just pointless, but hey, if you like it, then that's okay. They're just not for me.</p>
