        <p>Before there were "Avengers: Infinity War (2018)" and "Avengers: Endgame (2019)," there was one film that basically started the whole "crossover" thing in movies. That movie is called "Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (1988)."</p>
        <p>It's Los Angeles in 1940, in a universe where cartoons and humans coexist. Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer), a well-known cartoon character, appears to be leading a happy life until he finds out that his wife, Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner), is having an affair with the head of Maroon Cartoons. At that point, Roger's situation becomes problematic as he is suspected of killing Mr. Maroon (Alan Tilvern). Roger turns to Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a disgraced detective with a grudge against cartoons. In addition to trying to clear Roger's name, Eddie aids Roger, against his will, as they escape from the unyielding Judge Doom and travel throughout L.A., even venturing into Toontown.</p>
        <p>This film is known for being the biggest cartoon crossover movie, featuring characters from both Disney and Warner Bros. Mel Blanc, Wayne Allwine, Mae Questel, June Foray, and Clarence Nash all reprise their roles. It's a heartfelt tribute to all the cartoons we've grown up with and loved. I love the work that went into this film. It was groundbreaking to see animated cartoon characters interact with real-life human actors. Fun fact: this wasn't the first time this was attempted. "Anchors Aweigh (1945)" features a dance sequence between Gene Kelly and Jerry Mouse from Tom and Jerry. It was magical to see this concept be the central part of "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." It's like the actors are watching a real-life cartoon.</p>
        <p>With all that being said, is this a kids' movie? Seeing how it is filled with cartoons, yes, to a certain extent. But it was also made for adults. These cartoons have grown up with us, regardless if you're a Disney or WB kind of person. This is a funny film and a love letter to all people who watched these classic cartoons growing up. Plus, I have a sneaking suspicion that adults will enjoy it much more than children since they will understand how hard it was to make and how effortlessly it works. Kids will like it too, but they'll be questioning why people are wandering around within a cartoon rather than being impressed by how they managed to sneak the bunnies in with the humans.</p>
        <p>Before I wrap this up, the final line in this film is said by Porky Pig (Mel Blanc). Mel Blanc passed away a year after this film was made. Before his death, that final line was just a tribute to the WB cartoons and a reference to how they used to end. After Blanc's passing, it feels like a way of Mel Blanc saying, "That's all from me," when Porky Pig says, "That's all folks!"</p>
