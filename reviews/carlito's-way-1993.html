        <p>Brain De Palma's "Carlito's Way" is the third Mafia movie he's directed, and the second starring Al Pacino. After watching those films, including this one, I realized how much of a natural De Palma is when directing these kinds of movies. "Carlito's Way" in particular is very dark. It has no signs of hope, except in probably in a few scenes, and it's all bad luck for Carlito. You can tell he wanted to change in this movie, but all his past actions, even the ones that we witnessed in the film came back to bite him.</p>
        <p>This relentless cycle of fate is what makes "Carlito's Way" so gripping. The film revolves around themes of redemption and the inescapable pull of one's past, illustrating how difficult it is to break free from a life defined by crime and violence. Al Pacino's portrayal of Carlito Brigante is masterful; he embodies a man torn between his desire to leave his old life behind and the harsh realities that ensnare him.</p>
        <p>De Palma's direction adds a layer of intensity to the story, using stylish camera work and a haunting score to heighten the emotional impact. The way he constructs the narrative keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, as Carlito tries to navigate a treacherous world filled with betrayal and deceit. The supporting cast, including Sean Penn as the morally ambiguous David Kleinfeld, adds depth to the plot and demonstrates how relationships in this underworld can be both a source of support and a catalyst for tragedy.</p>
        <p>I had one problem with this movie. That was the ending. Why is Benny Blanco from the Bronx (John Leguizamo) the one who kills Carlito? He was just a side character causing trouble without relevance to the plot. It's not like his character was being developed or anything. I guess De Palma thought the ending should have a twist by having Benny kill Carlito and Pachanga (Luis Guzmán) betray him. It's not like it's wrong or anything; I just couldn't wrap my head around that.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, "Carlito's Way" serves as a powerful exploration of fate versus free will. Carlito's struggle is not just against the environment that shaped him but also against the inevitable consequences of his decisions. The film's climax, both shocking and poignant, forces the audience to confront the harsh realities faced by those who seek to change in a world that does not allow for change. It’s a haunting reminder of how the past can never be fully escaped, making it a standout entry in De Palma's filmography.</p>
