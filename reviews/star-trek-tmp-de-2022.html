        <p>*Please note that this is the review for the 2022 cut of the film. I reviewed the 2001 DVD, which you can find. I won't copy what I've said on that review, because there would be no point in this review. </p>
        <p>It isn't really common for a movie to take so long to complete, even if movies were completed, directors aren't really fans of going back to tamper with it, unless they weren't happy with the theatrical release. Robert Wise mentioned that it wasn't like him to go back and work on a movie after it was released. Working on Star Trek changed all of that. The movie is notorious for its troubled production, which Wise had to try to pick up the pieces and race to complete the film by December 7th, 1979. The result was an incomplete movie, which Wise had to carry with him on his flight to Washington, D.C. For many years, Wise was uncomfortable with the picture until he was asked to finish it for the 2001 DVD. That became known as "The Director's Edition," which, as I describe it, is a way for Wise to make peace with the movie.</p>
        <p>The 2001 DVD was marketed only as a straight-to-video release. It was released on DVD and VHS. That didn't matter to Wise, as he finally got to show the world what he wanted to show back in '79. The theatrical cut, which is just a workprint, as Wise described it, had a mixed reception until the "Special Longer Version" and eventually the "Director's Edition" were released. Those cuts allowed fans to understand the story a lot better.</p>
        <p>I was among many who dismissed TMP, which was the reason why I wasn't interested in Star Trek. However, once I picked up the 2001 Director's Edition DVD, I fell in love with the series and the movie. While it's not my favorite, it became a movie I deeply admire and respect. This became my third favorite. As controversial as that may seem, I see this as a work of art.</p>
        <p>Eleven years later, in 2022, Paramount released the Director's Edition, once again, on Blu-ray, 4K DVD, and on streaming websites. Even though Robert Wise is sadly no longer with us, he was able to "pass the torch" to producer David C. Fein, who worked on the 2001 DE DVD. Fein's goal this time wasn't a Blu-ray, 4K, or digital release; it was a new film negative to be released in cinemas. In my opinion, that was a wise decision. The fault of the 2001 DVD was that it was made specifically for home media.</p>
        <p>That sparked my interest, so I decided to give it a watch. Mainly for my eyes to drink in the beautiful visuals. Jokes aside, this cut is absolutely gorgeous. This new negative allows Richard Kline's cinematography to really shine and shows how romantic space really is. This new cut also fixes some problems that couldn't be addressed with the limited technology of the late '70s and '90s. Plus, it gives Jerry Goldsmith's score a digital remaster. To many fans, this is considered the best Star Trek soundtrack. It's my favorite for sure.</p>
        <p>I do believe films should receive similar treatment when being remastered. At least for older movies. It's part of the reason why Criterion exists. Plus, let this film be an example of why you shouldn't rush art. Robert Wise was a perfectionist, and it really shows here. In one way, this cut improves the story and the dialogue, but it does make the film a better experience than watching the 1979 theatrical cut (workprint). Rushing art results in messy results and outputs. But, at least we now have a proper version of The Motion Picture. Marking the film as finally complete.</p>
        <p>Robert Wise may no longer be with us, unfortunately, but I'm sure he was able to watch this cut, wherever he is.</p>
        <p>Now it's time for "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1989)" to receive a Director's Edition. Come on, Paramount! Give William Shatner a chance already!</p>
