        <p>I've always had a weird relationship with the movie. I haven't seen it since high school. It was for a class during senior year, but what exactly was it for? I can't tell you because I don't remember. All I remember was watching it with my friends—my teammates, who are also my buddies. I also remember liking it, but it didn't seem to stick with me, like many movies I watch. That led me to forget many things about it. Which I'm ashamed of.</p>
        <p>Upon this latest rewatch, I can see why I forgot most of this film. There's a lot to take in. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) explains a great deal after offering Neo (Keanu Reeves) the chance to join them. To me, it's just a bit too much. Not that it's bad in any way. It's helpful, but I don't think it should have been crammed into consecutive scenes. Maybe just some sort of gap between them.</p>
        <p>Yet within the rules they have established, the Wachowskis deliver a thrilling ride. The first half of this film is outstanding, showcasing Neo's character and the unexpected situation he finds himself in. However, once the second half kicks in, the focus shifts away from Neo’s larger destiny—ending the war between humans and machines—and instead zeroes in on the immediate mission to rescue Morpheus. While the rescue is thrilling and emotionally satisfying, it momentarily sidelines the grander narrative. That shift made the pacing feel a bit rushed to me. That said, I really appreciated the moment when Neo finally embraces who he is. His realization doesn’t just help him survive—it completes his arc. Even if the story narrows for a while, that payoff still lands. The rescue of Morpheus was still uplifting, as it gave the impression that any of them might survive.</p>
        <p>In this movie, Neo grapples with his sense of self, and the overwhelming information Morpheus provides doesn't make things any easier for him. To help clarify his path, Morpheus takes Neo to meet the Oracle. I appreciate how The Oracle delivers "bad news" to Neo but then offers him a cookie to comfort him, along with a rather blunt suggestion to move on.</p>
        <p>This film features incredible action scenes that have had a significant impact on cinema. Since "The Matrix" premiered, many movies have either parodied its style or attempted to replicate the entire film. Additionally, this film draws inspiration from certain scenes. For example, the sequence where Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) break into a building to save Morpheus resembles a scene from "The Terminator."</p>
        <p>While I don't consider this release to be one of the greatest movies of all time, I do think it is a fun and inspiring film from both the average moviegoer's and technical perspectives. I do feel like it has its problems, to which many will believe I'm dead wrong because they don't want some "critic" to criticize their favorite movie. But if it's a movie they hate, they wouldn't care.</p>
        <p>Regardless of my thoughts, that shouldn't stop you from watching this film. As I mentioned, it's a lot of fun, and you'll appreciate it for the visuals, action, acting, dialogue, and Keanu Reeves. For the plot? Probably not.</p>
