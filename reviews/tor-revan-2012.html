        <p>I really wanted to like this novel. I really did. Because I enjoyed both Knights of the Old Republic games developed by BioWare and Obsidian Entertainment, I thought this book would have storytelling on par with the two games. But to my surprise, I found it disappointing. What was more surprising is that the author, Drew Karpyshyn, wrote the story of the first game. I was impressed with his story for KOTOR 1, but disappointed with his story for this novel.</p>
        <p>I think the biggest reason for my disappointment was because of Revan's character. In KOTOR 1, the game was an RPG, meaning you could decide Revan's fate, what he should do, and how to end the game. Here, it ruined the whole purpose of that. It's the same way I felt about Revan talking in the Old Republic game.</p>
        <p>I also didn't like how barely any of the companions were mentioned in this novel. The only ones I recall seeing were T3-M4 and Canderous Ordo. Now that I think about it, this novel felt less about Revan and more like an advertisement for Scourge and the Old Republic game. The only thing I liked was the prologue. Other than that, it was disappointment all over.</p>
