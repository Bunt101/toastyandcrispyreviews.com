    <p>The 90s were known for Disney classics before the capitalist mouse took over. Is "A Goofy Movie" a classic? From a nostalgic standpoint, yes. Without rose-tinted glasses, it's hard to say. But let's take a closer look. Keep reading to find out!</p>
    <p>The film starts with Goofy's son, Max (Jason Marsden), trying to fit in at school and ask out his crush, Roxanne (Kellie Martin). He succeeds, but the principal doesn't think so, resulting in Max getting punished. Principal Mazur (Wallace Shawn) calls Goofy (Bill Farmer) to inform him about Max's actions and threatens him to re-evaluate the way he's raising Max before he ends up in the electric chair. Ignoring the fact that the school has an electric chair and that the principal straight up threatened a child with it, Goofy is in a bit of a pickle; he doesn't know what to do. So, he takes Pete's advice and takes Max to the great outdoors.</p>
    <p>What this film does well is its moral: no matter how different you may be from your father, family comes first. The voice cast, as always, is perfect, and the songs are very memorable.</p>
    <p>This film also has too many issues. The humor is meant for children and can come off as cheesy to adults. The pacing can be a bit slow, and the tone can be a bit wonky, considering how it jumps back and forth.</p>
    <p>Is this film considered a classic? Yes and no. It's an underrated Disney film, but definitely not the best. It isn't anything spectacular, just a fun family film. Ranking this 3 stars just feels right despite its issues.</p>
    <p>With that all being said, It's nice to see our old pal Goofy get a movie of his own.</p>
    <div rating="rating">Rating: 3/4 stars.</div>
