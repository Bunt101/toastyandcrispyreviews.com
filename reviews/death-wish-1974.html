    <h5>Charles Bronson as Paul Kersey in the film "Death Wish (1974)."</h5>
    <p></p>
    <p>This wasn't a film I had on my watchlist. In fact, I hadn't even heard about it until I found a DVD copy of "Death Wish (1974)" lying around in a box in my garage. So, I brought it in, put it into my DVD collection, and then asked my father about it. This was actually his DVD that he bought around 30 years ago. He began to tell me about the film, so I decided that I might as well check it out. I put this on hold for a while until October 2023. I caught a nasty cold with a horrible sore throat. All I could do was stay in bed, and that's when I decided to watch "Death Wish (1974)." To my surprise, I found myself enjoying the film. It's a simple film, but it's told in such a brilliant and clever way.</p>
    <p>The plot of this film begins with Paul's wife and daughter being stalked by three muggers. They eventually make their way to their place, murdering his wife (Hope Lange) and violently raping his daughter (Kathleen Tolan). This leaves Paul enraged by this act. Paul becomes even more frustrated when he finds out the police won't do anything. So, he decides that if the police won't protect the citizens, he must do it himself. It's a revenge film that really isn't an actual revenge film. As in, it's not a film where Paul Kersey attempts to locate the muggers that murdered his wife and raped his daughter; it's Paul protecting the citizens of New York City, as he doesn't want this to happen to anyone else.</p>
    <p>I liked this film. I liked the concept, the story, the acting, the music, and the message of the story, even though it's scary. While it would've been nice to see Paul Kersey encounter the three muggers, what he got instead is also a delightful treat. What I appreciate about this is how the film doesn't end with Paul Kersey getting revenge on those who murdered his wife and raped his daughter; instead, it ends with Paul's story coming to an end and starting a new life in Chicago.</p>
    <p>This film is underrated, and I don't understand why. I guess people were comparing it to "The Godfather: Part II (1974)" or "The Conversation (1974)," which I don't think is entirely fair. Movies are a visual form of entertainment and are created in different ways. I understand why people say this film is just Charles Bronson going around and killing people. While that's true, there’s also a reason for his actions. And if you don't know why, you aren't paying attention to the film or my review. Good job.</p>
    <p>With that all being said, despite being frightening, the film's darkness and message are potent, unsettling, and optimistic. The movie is thrilling, dark, terrifying, and entertaining. Charles Bronson gives a performance that will be remembered.</p>
