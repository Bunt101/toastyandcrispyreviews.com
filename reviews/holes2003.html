        <p>It had been ten years since I read the book and saw the film. After rewatching it, I realized how much I enjoyed it. Not only is it a faithful adaptation, but it also functions well as a standalone movie. The story is engaging, the cast is perfect, and it's just an enjoyable experience overall.</p>
        <p>The cast is great, Shia LaBeouf as Stanley is a great choice. He may not have a good reputation now, but this film is easily his best work. He gets along well with the other cast members and can build off of them easily. Khleo Thomas as Zero is a real one. He was a character that was just understood. He struggled his whole life but was able to see something in Stanley to allow him to finally reveal himself. Tim Blake Nelson and Jon Voight are just friendenemies. What more can I say? Sigourney Weaver as the warden, well, what can I say? How can a woman like her be hot and scary at the same time? I can't blame Mr. Sir and Dr. Pendanski for being scared and possibly horny at the same time.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the cinematography is stunning, beautifully capturing the original story's essence. The soundtrack perfectly complements the storyline, enhancing key scenes' emotional impact. I was also impressed by the character development, which brings depth to each role. Overall, it’s a film that resonates strongly with viewers, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll. When the credits roles in, I had forgotten how much I enjoyed this film, and in fact, loved it even more than I did 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>Moreover, there are subtle nuances in the film that pay homage to the book, making it a treat for fans of the original story. I found myself noticing details I hadn’t caught during my first viewing, which added layers to my understanding of the plot and characters. The way certain scenes are shot creates an atmosphere that draws you right in, making the viewer feel as if they are part of the journey. I think that's mostly due to the screenplay. The author of the book of the same name, Louis Sachar, wrote the screenplay himself, hence the movie's accuracy and faithfulness to the book. This is how movie adaptations should be. The author should be involved with the screenplay and the casting. Take a film like <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/the-shining-1980.html" target="_self">The Shining</a>, for example. Stanley Kubrick, the director refused to read a screenplay submmitted by Stephen King, the author of the original novel. He instead used The Shining novel just as a jumping-off point for the story he wanted to tell, so he saw no point in reading King’s script and collaborating with him on a new screenplay. But I digress.</p>
        <p>As I reflect on the film, I’m reminded of the emotions it stirred within me, from laughter to tears. It’s one of those rare movies that elicits such a strong emotional response, and I think that speaks volumes about its quality. Ultimately, I’m grateful I decided to revisit it; it reignited my appreciation for great storytelling and the magic of cinema. I'm already thinking about watching it again! Definitely not gonna wait 10 years to rewatch it, though.</p>
