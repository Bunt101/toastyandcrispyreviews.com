        <p><a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/marlonbrando.html" target="_self">Marlon Brando</a> is no stranger to Hollywood or the world. Many consider him to be one of the greatest actors ever. He is certainly one of my favorite actors. Surprisingly, when I first watched Brando in <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/thegodfather-1972.html" target="_self">The Godfather</a>, I knew nothing about him, but I was surprised by his performance in the film, so I continued to watch some of his other works, and that's how he became one of my favorite actors of all time. When something interests me greatly, I usually research it thoroughly. I began to do more and more research about Brando and learn about what kind of person he was both in Hollywood and outside.</p>
        <p>In addition to interviews, I watched the documentary <a href="https://bunt101.github.io/toastyandcrispyreviews.com/reviews/listen-to-me-marlon-2015.html" target="_self">Listen to Me Marlon</a>, and then I read his autobiography. This helped me learn more about Marlon Brando's personal life and the many adventures he experienced. Brando is a complex and often misunderstood character. While I don’t agree with many of his actions, I still find him fascinating. He was both an actor and an activist who led a troubled life, largely due to his childhood experiences, his family life, his parents, and his struggles with severe dyslexia. Both of his parents had issues of their own. Brando's mother, Dorthy, struggled with alcoholism and often chose drinks over raising her three children. Brando's father, Marlon Brando Sr., was cold, harsh, and tough, frequently being unkind toward his son.</p>
        <p>This sense of "abandonment" and neglect he felt from his parents led to Brando having an unhappy childhood. Often getting himself into trouble, only as a way to get attention. His dyslexia made it a huge obstacle in his life to do well in school, and since this was the 1930s, we're talking about, nobody really believed in that, which led to Brando repeating his sophomore year, and eventually getting expelled from both High Schools he attended, which the academy he attended reconsidered their decision. Even though being invited back, Brando chose not to continue school and moved to New York, to try finding a job there, like acting.</p>
        <p>That decision made Brando one of the most successful actors and beloved by many. However, he is often misunderstood, as many people believe the stories circulated online and in the media. These narratives are often crafted to tarnish the reputation of someone who is cherished by so many.</p>
        <p>Despite the negative portrayals, it’s essential to recognize Brando's contributions to cinema and his innovative approach to acting. He was not just a talented performer but also an influential figure who pushed the boundaries of his craft. His complex personality and intense passion for his work often led to misunderstandings, overshadowing his artistic achievements.</p>
        <p>Moreover, those who truly appreciate his legacy understand that every story has multiple sides. Brando’s life was filled with triumphs and struggles, making him a profoundly human figure. Through a more nuanced lens, we can celebrate his artistry while also acknowledging the imperfections that made him relatable. Ultimately, it's important to separate fact from fiction and honor the true essence of this iconic actor.</p>
