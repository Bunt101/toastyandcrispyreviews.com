        <p>This novel consistently tops the list whenever the EU is discussed. I had no idea what to anticipate going into this book. Plagueis was only known to me through the mythology Palpatine had related to Anakin in Revenge of the Sith. Yet, I was quite satisfied and fascinated after reading this book.</p>
        <p>The book dives deep into the mind of Darth Plagueis, his origins, his joruney until death, getting Palpatine as his appreciate, and his desires. James Luceno is known for lore expansion, and referencing a lot of the lore. It shows in this novel. This novel leds up to The Phantom Menace, during and after. This, Cloak of Deception, and Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter helped improve The Phantom Menace. It was awesome to see how this book places out during the events of the Phanton Menace.</p>
        <p>Other than Darth Plagueis, another character that is explored is Darth Sidious, aka Palpatine. James Luceno has said many times that Palpatine is his favorite character, and the way Luceno wrote Palpatine shows it. Who was Emperor Palpatine's Sith Master, and how is that question answered by Luceno? I mean, someone had to teach Darth Sidious the ways of the evil Sith. Darth Plagueis, whose true name is Hego Damassk II, is the answer. Damassk was a Muun (from the planet Muunilinst, a world of bankers and financial professionals) who thought that political and economic strategies may defeat the Sith's ultimate objective of galactic conquest instead of using pure aggression and violence.</p>
        <p>Damassk takes the young Palpatine under his wing after setting his sights on a young politician from Naboo. Palpatine has a talent for political power maneuvers early in his tenure in the Galactic Senate. Palpatine develops into a skilled Sith apprentice very rapidly with Damassk's financial support and—more importantly—Sith instruction.</p>
        <p>The book progresses quickly despite having very few actual action scenes, as Palpatine and Damassk engage in a covert political game of cat and mouse in an attempt to elevate Palpatine to the position of Chancellor and, eventually, Emperor. They also started the chain of events that would eventually lead to the Great Purge, also referred to as the Jedi Knights' demise.</p>
        <p>I knew this was going to be good because James Luceno is my favorite Star Wars author. But like I already said, I was pleasantly surprised by this. The dark side in this novel is extremely revolting, terrifying, eerie, and horrific, yet it's quite fascinating to read. This book has long been one of my favorites; although being slow and political, it perfectly foreshadows Palpatine's rise to powe.rI would strongly suggest this book if you're a fan of the Prequels. And, of course, the overall body of work by James Luceno.</p>
