        <p>Get nuts by thinking this is the best Batman movie. </p>
        <p>Tim Burton's Batman is a decent picture; It's the kind of movie you enjoy for its moments, even though they never add up. Made for (and possibly by) those with short attention spans, it lives in the present, providing one amazing spectacle after another, and not even trying to develop a story arc. Visually, the movie looks amazing. It truly captures the aesthetic vibe from the comic books. The film boasts the best Batman score, so good that it was even used in LEGO Batman: The Video Game. Let's also not forget Jack Nicholson's Joker.</p>
        <p>However, I do feel like this film has some issues. Batman (1989) has a plot that you don't really care about; it's a victory of beauty over substance and design over story, leaving Bruce Wayne/Batman feeling underdeveloped.</p>
        <p>With those criticisms in mind, that in no way makes it a bad Batman movie. But in order for it to be a really good Batman movie, we have to understand the character the movie is named after.If someone were to walk up to me on the street and ask what Batman from Batman (1989) is like, I wouldn't have an answer as I don't know who this guy even is. He's just a rich businessman with a suit and a deep voice, I guess?</p>
        <p>Michael Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne is a solid choice; I just wish he had more to do other than show up to save the day. His relationship with Vicki Vale is nothing but a love story that should never be. I couldn't understand what that character's motives or purpose is. Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent was also wasted potential. He should've stuck to being the administrator of Cloud City.</p>
        <p>Overall, Batman (1989) is not a bad picture; it's entertaining nonetheless, but it lacks many great opportunities. 35 years later, and it's still loved by many, but it's overshadowed by Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy.</p>
        <p>Is it worth seeing despite its age? Probably. Tim Burton surely made it entertaining to the eyes, but it lacks any good plot or character development.</p>
        <div class="rating">Rating: 3/4 stars. </div>
