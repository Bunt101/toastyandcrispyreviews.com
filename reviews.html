    <h2>Welcome to the reviews page! Here you can find my reviews of movies, books, and video games.</h2>
        <section>
            <p>Reviews are a great way to express yourself and share your opinions!</p>
            <p>A lot of people use the 'letter grade' ranking or use numbers out of 5 or 10. I like to rank things out of 4 stars. I'm a big fan of Roger Ebert and his ranking system has always stuck with me. In a way, my usage of the 4-star ranking can be a dedication to one of the greatest critics out there.</p>
            <p>Most reviews are written by me, but occasionally, I allow others to contribute. I will credit you, so don't worry about that. If I wrote the review, I wouldn't include that. So,  Don't be a coward and share your opinion with the world!</p>
            <p>Below are links to my movie, book, and game reviews. </p>
