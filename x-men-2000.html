        <p>When one thinks of superhero characters, movies, or even comics, the X-Men are fan favorites.</p>
        <p>The disastrous Batman & Robin (1997) film made everyone think that superhero movies couldn't be taken seriously. However, that all changed with Bryan Singer's X-Men.</p>
        <p>The film starts with a young woman named Rogue (Anna Paquin) who gets into trouble when she attempts to kiss her ex-boyfriend. She goes on the run and encounters Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who initially tells her to leave but then realizes she's just a young girl. Their relationship is one of the film's strong points. They're both mutants, sure, but it's their understanding of each other that makes the relationship work.</p>
        <p>Originally, he kicks her out his car, but once he realizes that she's only a kid, he comes back to get her and the two bond on the way, only to be interupted by Magento's Men. After getting attacked by Magneto's (Sir Ian McKellen) men, Logan finds himself at Professor X's (Sir Patrick Stewart) academy. Professor Charles Xavier is a psychic mutant with the ability to read minds, and he tries his best to help other mutants by not only providing them with an education but also teaching them how to control their powers.</p>
        <p>The mentor in this picture is none other than Professor Charles Xavier, a psychic mutant with the ability to read minds. He tries his best to help other mutants by not only providing them with an education but also teaching them how to control their powers. The main villain in this story is Magneto, who is after someone we suspect is Wolverine; however, it's not Wolverine he's after; it's Rogue. He's after her power.</p>
        <p>A scene that I think is handled well is Professor X explaining to Logan what his school is about and its purpose. Bryan Singer not only has Professor X explain it to us but also shows us a montage of scenes that is edited very well. Not only does it inform Logan what he is and what the mutants are, but it also gives a great explanation to the audience, especially if they haven't read the comics. Another thing to point out is David Hayter's screenplay. There are some excellent lines of dialogue in that film, and in my opinion, it's more enjoyable and more pleasant to listen to than most MCU films, which addons onto my point of having perfect casting in this picture.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, X-Men (2000) is full of excitement, action, great characters with top casting, great set design, a fun plot, and awesome superpowers! It's not the best X-Men film, but it's definitely a fun one! The film could have explored a bit more on characters like Storm and Cyclops, plus some of the villains, but what we've got makes up for that.</p>
        <p>Superman: The Movie (1978) is the blueprint of how to make a good superhero story; X-Men (2000), along with Spider-Man (2002), helped spawn the modern superhero genre of films. </p>
