        <p>This was a fun read. Although not the best, I still really enjoyed it. The same feeling I felt with all of James Luceno's novels.</p>
        <p>This novel picks up four weeks after Revenge of the Sith. The Jedi are all but extinct, the Republic has been reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, etc. Vader is slowly getting used to his new life. I love the pain he goes through in this novel. It is really well written. I thought it was a smart move to choose this time period because after Revenge of the Sith, we only knew Vader as he was in the Original Trilogy—a different person, with little to no Anakin in him. More machine than man. I also liked the other perspective in this novel. Roan Shryne was a fascinating Jedi, and I love this new life he has to try to live after Order 66 along with the other Jedi. The novel is packed with great action scenes, small moments of humor, and great old and new characters.</p>
        <p>The scenes on Alderaan build up a lot of tension. This is when Bail Organa learns that Anakin Skywalker survived and is now in the Darth Vader suit. Bail also gets to "meet" Vader, despite the two already knowing each other from the past. There was one moment that left me on the edge of my seat. When Vader asks to meet Bail's wife and Leia, I was afraid that was actually going to happen, even though I already knew it wasn't. That's just how brilliant James Luceno is as a writer. The epilogue is one of the best parts. It cuts to Obi-Wan shortly after dropping off Luke with Owen and Beru Lars. Obi-Wan is sitting in a cantina when he finds out that Anakin survived and is in the Darth Vader suit. After hearing that, he becomes worried that he and Luke are on Anakin's home planet, but his worry eases when Qui-Gon's voice reaches out to him. Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan not to worry because Anakin wouldn't step foot on a planet that caused him pain. Also, he advises not to tell Luke the truth until the time is right. A much better explanation than the Kenobi show.</p>
        <p>If you're a fan of Vader, then i'm sure you'll love this novel.</p>
